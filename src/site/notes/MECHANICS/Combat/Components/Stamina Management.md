<center>BALANCE & CONSEQUENCE</center>

---

In *Chronicle*’s combat system, **stamina** isn’t just a secondary bar- it’s the backbone of every offensive and defensive move. Whether you’re swinging a sword, [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Blocking\|Blocking]] a heavy blow, or [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Dodging\|Dodging]] a lethal strike, your available stamina dictates *how hard* and *how often* you can act. Enemies are exempt from this system.

## The Role of Stamina in Combat

1. **Attacking**  
   
   - **Light Attacks**: Low stamina cost, faster recovery. Good for steady damage but less capable of shattering enemy posture in a single hit.  
   
   - **Heavy/Power Attacks**: High stamina cost; these can significantly drain an enemy’s posture or dish out massive damage, but leave you vulnerable if missed.

2. **Defending**  
   
   - **Blocking**: Each successful block drains stamina. Consecutive blocks can deplete you fast, leading to a guard break that leaves you wide open. With higher levels of Stamina (e.g a larger pool), consecutive blocks can also lead to [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|Posture]] break, which will also leave you staggered for a moment.
   
   - **Dodging**: Dodges, whether quick steps or rolling maneuvers, also consume stamina. Overspending can lock you out of further evasive options when you need them most.

3. **Exhaustion Windows**  
   
   - When stamina falls to zero you may enter a brief **exhaustion window**. During this time, heavy attacks or advanced maneuvers (like perfect dodges) are disabled until you recover enough stamina. It’s a forced lull that can quickly shift momentum in the enemy’s favor.

## Trade-offs & Strategy

1. **Aggression vs. Conservation**  
   
   - **Sustained Offensive**: Rapid strikes can overwhelm enemy posture, but if you empty your stamina bar, you risk being unable to dodge or block follow-ups.  
   
   - **Measured Defense**: Blocking or conservative jabs preserve stamina, but risk letting the enemy dictate the fight’s pace.


1. **Combos & Cooldowns**  
   
   - Certain skills chain into combos that deliver high burst damage but consume more stamina per strike.  
   
   - *Chronicle* incorporates short “cooldown” periods on special techniques—using them incorrectly can drain stamina right when you need it most.

---
## Maintaining Momentum

1. **Posture Synergy**  
   
   - Depleting stamina too quickly weakens your ability to recover posture. When forced on the defensive with no stamina left to block or dodge, a single heavy blow can stagger you outright.

2. **Positioning & Environment**  
   
   - If you’re running low on stamina mid-fight, use the environment. Back off behind a pillar or force the enemy into a narrow space to buy precious recovery seconds. This interplay of stamina and spatial awareness is key to survival.

3. **Recovery Windows**  
   
   - Stamina regenerates at a steady pace if you refrain from strenuous actions for a moment (e.g., not attacking or blocking). In the midst of combat, finding those micro-breaks can be the difference between victory and a lethal mistake.

## Avoiding the Brink

1. **Reading Enemy Attacks**  

- A well-timed dodge or parry costs less stamina than soaking multiple hits with your guard. Focus on learning enemy patterns to minimize unnecessary stamina loss.

2. **Combo Restraint**  
   
   - Resist the urge to spam heavy attacks. Mixing in lighter, stamina-friendly strikes can keep you from hitting exhaustion at a critical juncture.

3. **Awareness of Exhaustion Windows**  
   
   - If you’re nearing your stamina limit, consider a brief retreat or switch to minimal-movement tactics until you recover enough for a decisive counter.

## Conclusion

In *Chronicle*, combat is intended to be lethal and swift; a drained stamina bar can quickly spiral into defeat. Even a powerful character is vulnerable with no stamina left to block or dodge. By tying **every** major action to a single resource, the system rewards thoughtful and [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Immersion\|immerisve]] play, every slash, block, or dodge must be weighed against potential exhaustion. While stamina in exploration or travel is detailed elsewhere, know that a fatigued or malnourished fighter enters combat at a disadvantage. This underscores the **holistic** [[MECHANICS/Survival/Survival Overview\|survival]] experience that defines *Chronicle*. In short, **stamina** is your life-force. Managing it carefully and balancing aggression with caution separates the novice from the seasoned warrior. Emptying your reserves at the wrong time can leave you defenseless, while conserving just enough for a clutch dodge or block can turn the tide of battle. By demanding that *every* swing, block, and evasion draws from the same pool, *Chronicle* ensures each fight bristles with tension and **hard-won triumph**.
