## Core Concept

**Posture** represents a combatant’s ability to stay composed and guarded under pressure. Whenever you **take a hit**, **block**, or absorb certain magical attacks, your Posture depletes. If it’s fully **broken**, you become staggered or otherwise left open for a devastating follow-up attack.

## Depletion & Recovery

### Depletion

- **Weapon Strikes**: Every incoming blow, whether blocked or partially absorbed reduces Posture.  

- **Heavy Attacks**: Large weapons or powerful enemy strikes inflict significant Posture damage; some may break your stance in one shot if you fail to dodge or block properly.  

- **Magical Attacks**: Spells can also damage Posture, especially those designed to concuss or disrupt. While pure “elemental” spells (like a small flame burst) might cause less Posture drain than a physical blow, larger or more forceful magic (such as a shockwave, telekinetic push, or heavy arcane blast) can inflict major damage to your stance.

### Recovery

- **Short Window**: Posture regenerates naturally if you avoid being hit or [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Blocking\|Blocking]] for a brief period often a few seconds.  

- **Condition Ties**: Being [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|well-rested]] and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|nourished]] can speed up Posture recovery; being starved or exhausted slows it.  

- **Spacing & Strategy**: Stepping back or timing a [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Dodging\|dodge]] to create breathing room allows for faster Posture resets- helpful if you’re near the breaking point.

## Universal for Players, Varied for Foes

- **Players** share a base Posture pool though certain gear (e.g., tower shields, armor perks) may reduce the drain.  

- **Enemies** have unique Posture values: knowing each foe’s resilience is essential. Some can be overwhelmed quickly, while others require sustained pressure to topple.

## Strategic Interplay

1. **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]] & [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Weapon Tempo\|Weapon Tempo]]**  
   
   - Aggressively attacking to shatter an enemy’s Posture consumes Stamina.  
   
   - **Slow, heavy weapons** deal high Posture damage but leave you vulnerable between swings.

2. **Dodging vs. Blocking**  
   
   - **Blocking** is more straightforward but heavily drains Posture over consecutive hits.  
  
   - **Dodging** avoids Posture damage entirely, but costs Stamina and precise timing.

2. **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Critical Windows\|Critical Windows]]**  
  
   - When an enemy’s Posture is near broken, a perfectly placed strike or spell can **stagger** them, opening a **Critical Window** for finishing moves or high-damage combos.  
 
   - A near-broken Posture bar on *your* side spells trouble: even a minor hit can stagger you.

2. [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Cooldowns\|Cooldowns]]
   
   - Repeated heavy strikes or spells can lead to **Exhaustion** windows, temporarily limiting your offensive burst.  
   
   - Enemies may recover Posture during your cooldown, shifting momentum.

2. **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Environmental Interactions\|Environmental Interactions]]**  
   
   - Terrain, walls, and obstacles can amplify Posture damage (e.g., being slammed into a corner).  
   
   - Clever positioning can trap foes in tight spaces, accelerating their Posture break.

## Pace of Combat

Posture regulates the **rhythm** of each fight. Short, explosive clashes occur if both sides push Posture to the brink quickly. Slower duels emerge when participants choose to trade cautious hits and retreat to recover. Every encounter becomes a **test of nerve**: press your advantage to break the enemy’s stance, or pull back to rebuild your own before a decisive blow.

## [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Immersion\|Immersion]] & Feedback

- **Minimal UI**: Subtle animations or shaky weapon grips hint at reduced Posture, aligning with *Chronicle*’s less-is-more interface approach.  

- **Enemy Cues**: When an enemy’s Posture wanes, it may visibly stagger, lower its guard, or move erratically, a chance to strike.

## Ties to Survival & World Level

- **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Survival Overview\|Survival]] Factors**: Fatigue, hunger, [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|Thirst]] and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|injury]] reduce your **rate of Posture recovery**, reinforcing the importance of maintaining your basic needs.  

- **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]] Scaling**: Higher-level enemies may possess bigger Posture pools or quicker recovery. Even familiar foes remain threatening if you can’t sustain the pressure required to shatter their stance.
