<center>THE IMMOVABLE BULWARK, THE UNBROKEN SHIELD</center>

---

Blocking is a **primary defensive action** in *Chronicle*, allowing you to absorb or deflect incoming attacks at the cost of **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]]** and **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|Posture]]**. The effectiveness of your block depends heavily on **what** you’re blocking with, ranging from a sturdy tower shield to an off-hand dagger. Knowing when to block and with which tool is a vital decision that shapes your overall combat strategy.

## Core Mechanics of Blocking

1. **Stamina Drain**  
   
   - Each successful block depletes your stamina. Heavier blows consume more, and repeated blocks in a short timeframe can exhaust you. Overextending to block multiple strong hits risks hitting an **Exhaustion Window**, where advanced maneuvers (like counters or heavy attacks) temporarily become unavailable.

2. **Posture Damage**  
   
   - While blocking avoids direct health damage, each impact **chips away at your posture**- too much, too quickly, and your guard collapses.  Recovery of posture is slower if you remain in a constant blocking stance, forcing you to pick moments to lower your guard or move out of harm’s way.

3. **Recovery Window**  
   
   - After a block, there’s a small window where your guard is slightly weakened. Opponents can chain attacks or pivot to a different angle if you fail to react.

## Blocking Tools & Their Differences

1. **Shields**  
   - **Heavy Shields**:  
     - Reduce stamina and posture loss more effectively due to larger coverage and bracing potential.  
     - Typically heavier, so overall stamina drains faster if you move or sprint with them.  
     - Good for tanky builds that can sustain direct hits.  
   
   - **Small Shields**:  
     - Designed more for **parrying** than absorbing large amounts of damage.  
     - They reduce stamina/posture damage less effectively on standard blocks, pushing the player to time parries or quick blocks.  
     - Faster to raise or lower, letting agile fighters maintain mobility.

2. **Off-Hand Weapons**  
   - Blocking with a second weapon offers minimal coverage but more offensive flexibility, ideal for dual-wield builds. However, each strong hit can significantly degrade the off-hand weapon if it’s used to block heavy blows. They have more posture damage taken on a successful block compared to a shield, reinforcing the “offensive defense” style (parrying or short blocks rather than turtling).

3. **Two-Handed Grip**  
   - If a weapon can be held in two hands (e.g., large swords, staves), you can attempt to block with it, but it’s usually **less stable** than a dedicated shield. There is a higher risk of guard break and noticeable stamina drain, though still a viable option for players who prioritize consistent offensive reach over carrying a shield.

## Interplay with [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Parrying\|Parrying]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Skills And Talents\|Skills, & Talents]]

1. **Parry Windows**  
   
   - Smaller shields (bucklers) or off-hand weapons often have built-in parry frames—*a narrower margin but potentially huge rewards* if timed perfectly. Missing a parry with a light tool inflicts more posture/stamina damage than a block with a heavy shield.

2. **Skill & Talent Synergies**  
   
   - Certain passive and active skills or talents may reduce stamina drain when blocking, or lower posture damage from consecutive hits. Others can increase the effectiveness of off-hand blocks, or slow weapon durability loss when blocking. Some minimize the stamina cost of moving in heavy armor and bracing behind a tower shield.

3. **Counterattacks**  
   
   - Some Skills allow you to transition from a block into a powerful strike if you block an enemy’s heavy attack at the last second. Parrying and blocking synergy builds could revolve around hooking an enemy’s weapon with a buckler or off-hand blade before riposting.

## Combat Flow & Strategy

1. **Stamina Balancing**  
   
   - Excessive blocking in a short period can rapidly deplete your stamina, leaving you defenseless against follow-up attacks. Learning to alternate between blocking, dodging, and attacking is key to avoiding an untimely guard break.

2. **Positioning & Movement**  
   
   - Heavy shield users might **hold ground**, controlling choke points and trading stamina for safety.  Off-hand block users or buckler carriers might **dart in and out**, prioritizing parries or quick reaction blocks to minimize the cost of absorbing hits.

3. **Supporting Multiple Playstyles**  
   
   - Tower shield builds excel in stalling or tanking groups, creating openings for allies or letting you whittle down enemies with minimal risk. Light shield and off-hand defenders rely on skillful reaction times, capitalizing on parries and counters rather than static defenses.

## Conclusion

Blocking in *Chronicle* is not a passive act; it’s a **dynamic choice** shaped by your equipment, stamina reserves, and posture management. From heavily braced shields that soak hits with minimal posture loss to agile off-hand weapons meant for opportunistic parries, the system offers varied defensive flavors. Understanding the differences, how each shield or weapon interacts with stamina, posture, and damage mitigation reinforces *Chronicle*’s **philosophy of intentional combat**, where every action is a careful balance of **risk and reward** in the relentless world of Velmoryth.
