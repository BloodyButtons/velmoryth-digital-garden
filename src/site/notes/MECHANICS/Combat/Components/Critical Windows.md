<center>THINK ON YOUR FEET</center>

---

A **Critical Window** is a split-second opening in combat that allows you to unleash a **devastating counter**, inflicting substantial [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|Health]] and [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|posture]] damage. For lightly armored characters who rely on [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Dodging\|Dodging]] or [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Parrying\|Parrying]] instead of tower shields and plate armor, taking advantage of these brief moments can be the difference between victory and defeat ***for both you and your enemy***.

## Foundations of the Critical Window

1. **Timing & Telegraphs**  
   
   - Critical Windows emerge when an enemy **overextends** or has its **posture broken**, leaving it briefly staggered.  
   
   - Recognizing the enemy’s **movement cues**- the exact instant they lose balance, is key to capitalizing on this short opportunity.

2. **Massive Damage Potential**  
   
   - Strikes landed during a Critical Window often **bypass** or **amplify** damage calculations.  
   
   - Even foes with high health or posture can be felled swiftly if the blow lands at just the right time.

3. **High-Risk Maneuver**  
   
   - Missing or arriving late to a Critical Window can waste valuable [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]] and give the enemy time to recover.  
   
   - Overeager attacks leave you open if your stamina is too low to adapt or if you misjudge the enemy’s recovery speed.

## Interplay with Stamina & Survival States

1. **Stamina Investment**  
   
   - Executing a heavy counter or well-timed strike requires stamina. If you’re nearly exhausted, you might not be able to deliver a decisive follow-up. Balancing the stamina cost of defense  and offense is pivotal.

2. **Condition Penalties**  
   
   - [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|Injured]], [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|malnourished]], or [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigued]] characters react **slower**, making it harder to land a precise blow in the fleeting Critical Window.  A robust [[MECHANICS/Survival/Survival Overview\|survival]] routine, maintaining proper sleep, nourishment, and healing directly impacts your **reaction times** and overall efficacy in these clutch moments.

3. **Compatibility with Parry & Dodge**  
   
   - Parrying or dodging an enemy attack often **triggers** or **reveals** a Critical Window if the enemy is left off-balance. Lightly armored builds lacking the safety of heavier defenses must hone these reactive maneuvers to survive.

## Immersion & Combat Flow

1. **No Excessive UI**  
   - *Chronicle* communicates a Critical Window primarily through **enemy animations**—a lurch, stumble, or audio cue—rather than on-screen markers. There is an unmistakable audio cue specifically for these windows. You must remain engaged and [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Immersion\|immersed]], catching subtle signs the enemy has left itself exposed.

2. **Fast, Lethal Exchanges**  
   
   - The game’s unforgiving design means that both you and your foes can dish out lethal punishment in a heartbeat. Rapidly seizing a Critical Window creates dynamic shifts in momentum, pushing the **tension** of each confrontation.

3. **Reward for Skill & Awareness**  
   - The satisfaction of reading an enemy’s movement, reserving stamina for the moment they falter, and landing that one decisive blow underscores *Chronicle*’s ethos of **hard-earned triumph**.

## Conclusion

Critical Windows embody *Chronicle*’s hallmark blend of **deadly realism** and **skillful timing**. By carefully observing enemy attacks, managing your stamina, and leveraging these fleeting openings, even lightly armored adventurers can deliver fatal blows to formidable foes. Yet the cost is steep: missing the window drains precious resources and invites a brutal counterattack, especially if you’re battered by fatigue or hunger. In this way, *Chronicle* cements the idea that **every second matters**, demanding foresight, precision, and a commitment to survival in Velmoryth’s harsh and unforgiving battles.
