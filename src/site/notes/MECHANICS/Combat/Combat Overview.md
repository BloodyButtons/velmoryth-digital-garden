## Combat Overview

Combat in *Chronicle* is a lethal dance of **timing**, **resource management**, and **situational awareness**. At its core lies **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]]** and [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Stamina Management\|Stamina Management]], which governs nearly every offensive and defensive action- swinging a sword, [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Blocking\|blocking]] a crushing blow, or sprinting to safety. Because Stamina is also tied to **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Survival Overview\|Survival]]** needs like [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|Hunger]] and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|Fatigue]], a poorly rested or malnourished character will find themselves gasping for breath mid-battle, reinforcing the game’s uncompromising focus on realism and **[[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Immersion\|Immersion]]**. 

Weapons each have a distinct **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Weapon Tempo\|Weapon Tempo]]**, the measured pace of attack and recovery. A massive warhammer delivers devastating strikes but leaves you vulnerable if timed poorly, while lighter blades allow swifter combos at the cost of raw stopping power. Layered onto this is a system of **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Cooldowns\|Cooldowns]]** (or short exhaustion windows) preventing you from spamming powerful moves without consequence. Meanwhile, **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|Posture]]** tracks your balance and guard integrity: every clash or block erodes it, and when it breaks, you’re left wide open for a devastating counter. The most skilled fighters exploit **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Critical Windows\|Critical Windows]]**, those precise instants where a perfect parry or well-timed strike inflicts critical damage or creates an opening for a finishing blow.

Both **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Dodging\|Dodging]]** and **Blocking** provide defensive depth. A well-timed dodge can bypass an enemy’s swing entirely, yet it costs precious Stamina and demands spatial awareness. Blocking is more forgiving, but repeated blows hammer away at your Posture, risking a guard break if you turtle too long. Finally, **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Environmental Interactions\|Environmental Interactions]]** plays a pivotal role: uneven terrain, narrow corridors, and environmental hazards can impede both you and your foes, making positioning essential. Above all, combat weaves seamlessly into *Chronicle*’s **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]]** escalation, enemies grow deadlier as you gain power or as time passes, ensuring that complacency is never an option and every conflict remains high-stakes. Even a small miscalculation can be fatal, lending every encounter a sense of tension that pervades the game’s dark and immersive world.
