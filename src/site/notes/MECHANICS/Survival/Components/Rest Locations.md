<center>EVER-FLEETING RESPITE</center>

---

In *Chronicle*, Rest Locations are vital points of reprieve and recovery scattered throughout Velmoryth. These range from simple wilderness campsites and hidden caves to fortified outposts, villages, and major [[MECHANICS/Overworld/Settlements\|settlements]]. Each Rest Location serves as a crucial sanctuary where players can safely attend to their survival needs, away from the threats posed by Velmoryth’s harsh environments and dangerous inhabitants.

## Importance to Survival

Rest Locations provide the essential opportunity for the player to safely manage their basic needs such as eating, drinking, and sleeping without immediate threat from hostile encounters. They represent moments of calm in an otherwise relentless world, allowing players to manage [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|hunger]], [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|thirst]], and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]] levels effectively.

## Recovery and Healing

These sanctuaries offer players the safety needed to treat and recover from [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|injuries]], diseases, and other ailments accumulated during exploration or [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Combat\|combat]]. While it's possible to apply bandages, splints, or consume antidotes on the move, performing these actions at a Rest Location significantly improves their effectiveness and reduces the risk of interruptions.

Additionally, resting allows the player to alleviate status effects such as Minor Bleeding, Fatigue, or [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|Disease]] more thoroughly. Severe injuries and conditions typically require prolonged rest to fully recover, reinforcing the strategic importance of regularly seeking out these safe havens.

## Strategic Planning and Preparedness

Rest Locations encourage careful and deliberate planning of expeditions. Players must identify and mark Rest Locations on their maps, strategically planning journeys between them to ensure safety, optimal resource usage, and effective exploration.

Setting up a camp in a hostile region can serve as a temporary Rest Location, allowing players to pause, resupply, update maps, and prepare for the challenging terrain or encounters ahead. In settlements or established outposts, players can replenish critical supplies, trade with merchants, seek medical or magical treatments, and gather essential information to guide their next moves.

## Interaction with Other Systems

The existence and use of Rest Locations deeply intertwine with multiple core systems:

- **Survival:** Provides essential management of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|temperature]].

- **Combat:** Enables players to heal wounds, recover [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|posture]] and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]], and maintain or repair weapons and equipment.

- **Exploration:** Encourages deliberate planning, resource allocation, and [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Mapping\|mapping]] out safe routes between known Rest Locations.

Ultimately, Rest Locations anchor the rhythm and pacing of *Chronicle*, offering critical periods of respite that balance the intense survival, exploration, and combat experiences throughout Velmoryth.
