<center>HOW DOES AN UNDEAD CONTINUE LIVING?</center>

---

Undead adventurers in *Chronicle* exist outside the typical constraints of [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|Hunger]], [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|Thirst]], and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|Fatigue]], instead wrestling with the very nature of their cursed existence. Rather than managing traditional survival stats, Undead characters face unique, existential threats shaped by their supernatural condition. Theirs is a journey defined not by sustaining life, but by navigating the harsh limitations of their unlife.

---

## Sunlight Vulnerability 

Undead characters are profoundly vulnerable to sunlight. Exposure to daylight directly harms their corrupted flesh, rapidly diminishing health and limiting their ability to traverse the open world freely.

### Protective Garments

To mitigate the sun's lethal effects, Undead must acquire and maintain protective garments such as heavy cloaks, hoods, enchanted cloth, or specialized armor, allowing daytime travel with manageable discomfort. While these items are relatively common, especially within black markets and among shady merchants, they aren't immediately available at the start, making initial gameplay an intense struggle for survival under cover of darkness.

### Gameplay Impact

- **Travel Restrictions:** Early game exploration and travel are confined largely to nighttime hours, requiring careful route planning and navigation. Mistiming a journey may force desperate retreats to shelter. Daylight combat without protective gear is nearly impossible. Fighting in sunlight rapidly drains [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|Health]], forcing Undead players to plan encounters meticulously around the cycles of night and day.

---

## Social Stigma 

The Undead are universally vilified and feared by most mortal communities. Town guards, merchants, and commoners alike will typically refuse service or even attack on sight, complicating access to supplies, safe havens, and allies.

### Disguise & Stealth

To function within society, Undead must employ stealth, deception, or disguises. They often rely on theft, infiltration, or subterfuge to procure resources or gather information. This encourages a cautious and thoughtful approach to interactions, making each social encounter a high-risk scenario.
 Players must plan carefully, relying on theft, black markets, or secluded traders who are sympathetic or indifferent to their nature. Finding secure locations to rest, heal, or repair gear becomes a strategic task, reinforcing immersion through deliberate role-playing and exploration. Quests must be approached cautiously, with disguises becoming vital tools in ensuring successful interactions without violent reprisals.

## Immunities and Resistances 

Despite their vulnerabilities, Undead possess significant supernatural resistances. They cannot suffer from [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|Disease]] or [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|Injuries]], making them uniquely resilient in specific combat and survival scenarios. This resilience offers tactical advantages, offsetting their environmental and social limitations.

### Gameplay Impact

- **Combat Advantages:** The inability to bleed or contract diseases allows Undead players to handle certain enemies—such as plague-ridden beasts or bleed-focused opponents—with ease, shaping their preferred combat scenarios. Immunity to disease means less reliance on medicine and antidotes, freeing inventory space for essential stealth and disguise items.

## Relation to Combat and Exploration

Undead characters face a starkly different combat and exploration experience compared to their organic counterparts:

- **Combat Dynamics:**  

  Combat strategy revolves heavily around nighttime engagements, ambushes, and stealth tactics. Players must exploit darkness, surprise, and positioning, ensuring battles occur on their terms.

- **Exploration Considerations:**  

  [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Navigation\|Navigation]] and [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Mapping\|Mapping]] must carefully account for time of day, potential sources of shelter, and safe routes to maintain health and security. Risky daylight exploration may be necessary, but demands careful planning and adequate protection.

- **Preparedness & Planning:**  

  Unlike other races, Undead preparedness involves identifying and securing daytime shelter, scouting nighttime travel routes, and procuring reliable sources of disguise or protection. Each journey is a deliberate exercise in logistical forethought.

## Conclusion

Playing an Undead character in *Chronicle* transforms survival into an existential struggle rather than a bodily one. Instead of managing hunger, thirst, and rest, Undead players must overcome the deep-seated threats of societal hatred, environmental hostility, and daylight exposure. Their unique vulnerabilities and resistances create dynamic, engaging gameplay—shaped equally by meticulous stealth, cunning social manipulation, and strategic nighttime combat—providing a deeply immersive experience distinct from any other race in Velmoryth.
