<center>DEATH BY DEHYDRATION</center> 

---

Thirst in *Chronicle* goes beyond a simple hydration bar, it's a **fundamental** survival stat that directly impacts your **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Mana\|Mana]] reserves**, limiting how effectively you can cast spells if you let your body become dehydrated. Like [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|Hunger]] and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|Fatigue]], thirst **ticks down** at a steady rate as you explore Velmoryth’s demanding environments, forcing you to balance your need for water against the risk of carrying extra weight. Failing to maintain proper hydration can lock you out of your full magical potential and leave you vulnerable in both combat and survival situations.

## Core Thirst Mechanics

- **Independent Stat**  
  
  - Thirst isn’t tied to your [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Attributes Overview\|attributes]] (like INT or VIT), so even powerful characters can suffer harsh penalties if they neglect to drink. Falling below critical thresholds can cap your **maximum mana**, representing the toll dehydration takes on your mental clarity and magical acuity.

- **Racial Variation**  
  
  - Different races require different amounts of hydration. For example, **Humans** require a moderate but steady intake of water. **Elves** tend to need slightly less, reflecting a more efficient metabolism.  **Mycari**, composed of living fungus, paradoxically need *more* water to keep their fungal networks moist and functional, especially in arid zones.

## Impact on Combat & Exploration

- **Spellcasting & Mana**  
  
  - A dehydrated caster finds their mana reserves curtailed, making complex or high-level spells unfeasible until they rehydrate. Even melee-focused warriors who rely on magical buffs or hybrid skills can find themselves handicapped by dryness and fatigue.

- **Extended Journeys**  
  
  - Thirst is critical on **long treks** through deserts or sun-scorched badlands. Planning water storage or knowing where to refill can make the difference between success and disaster.  Swamps or jungle environments may seem water-rich, but unsafe or contaminated sources might lead to **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|Disease]]** so you must boil or purify water to avoid infection.

- **Environmental Hazards**  
  
  - High [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|Temperature]] or intense physical exertion (climbing, constant combat) accelerate thirst. Water scarcity can be a strategic factor. fire-based spells or forging steel in scorching areas might elevate your dehydration rate, demanding extra water consumption.

## Ties to Other Survival Systems

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|Encumbrance]] & Supplies**  
  
  - Lugging multiple waterskins or a barrel of fresh water increases **encumbrance**, slowing you down and raising stamina use. Failing to carry enough water, however, forces frequent stops to scavenge or gather from natural sources- rivers, oases, or melting snow.

- **Hunger & Temperature Management**  
  
  - Eating salty or dried foods without access to water intensifies dehydration. In cold regions, melting snow for a drink can stave off thirst but drains time and resources for fuel.  Temperature extremes (desert heat or polar chill) complicate thirst, requiring greater planning around how and when you hydrate.

- **Preparation & Mapping**  
  
  - Marking known water sources on your map or carrying specialized talents (e.g., water-finding spells, survivalist training) can prevent dire shortages.  Each journey’s route might hinge on passing by a crucial stream or well to stay topped up.

## Conclusion

Thirst in *Chronicle* underscores how **frail** even the mightiest adventurers can be under nature’s extremes. By binding dehydration to **mana** capacity, *Chronicle* seamlessly integrates a fundamental survival concern with both **combat potential** and **exploration** strategy. Whether you’re an intrepid ranger hauling waterskins across desert dunes, or a Mycari mystic reliant on regular hydration for fungal health, managing thirst is a perpetual balancing act between power, mobility, and the relentless demands of Velmoryth’s landscapes.
