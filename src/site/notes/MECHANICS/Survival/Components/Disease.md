<center>THE CURSE OF THE MATERIAL PLANE</center>

---

In *Chronicle*, diseases add a dangerous layer of realism and consequence to exploration, [[MECHANICS/Combat/Combat Overview\|combat]], and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Survival Overview\|survival]]. Players can contract diseases from various sources, including rotten food, environmental hazards, and infected enemies. These diseases don't just affect [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|Health]] in a straightforward manner- they impact core systems such as **Health**, **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Mana\|Mana]]**, **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]]**, **Recovery Rates**, **Movement Speed**, and more. Diseases force players to manage more than just [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|injuries]] and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|hunger]], they must adapt to and recover from debilitating conditions that threaten every aspect of their survival.

## Types of Diseases

### **Food Poisoning**

- **Cause:** Eating spoiled or rotten food, drinking unclean water.

- **Effects:**  
  
  - **Health:** Gradual health drain (**2% per in-game hour**) for the first 24 hours.
  
  - **Mana:** Mana regeneration is slowed by **30%** for 24 in-game hours.
  
  - **Stamina:** Increased stamina usage (**10%**) due to nausea and discomfort.
  
  - **Recovery Rates:** Health recovery from food and rest is **50% slower**.
  
  - **Movement Speed:** Reduced movement speed by **5%**.
 
  - **Hunger & [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|Thirst]]:** Hunger decreases at **double the normal rate** as the body expends energy to combat the poison.
  
  - **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|Fatigue]]:** Fatigue increases at a **5% faster rate** due to ongoing sickness.
  
- **Duration:** 1 in-game day.

- **Cure:** Consuming clean water, resting, and taking herbal remedies or specific antidotes from an apothecary. **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Medical Supplies/Medical Supplies\|Antidote]]** will completely cure it.

### **Blight**

- **Cause:** Infection from contaminated water sources, or exposure to certain pestilence-carrying enemies like diseased rats, insects, or creatures in swampy regions.

- **Effects:**  
  
  - **Health:** Decreases by **1% per in-game hour** for 2 in-game days.
  
  - **Mana:** Mana regeneration reduced by **40%**.
  
  - **Stamina:** Major stamina drain (**15% increase**) due to chills and weakness.
  
  - **Recovery Rates:** Health recovery through any means is **50% slower** during the disease duration.
  
  - **Movement Speed:** Reduced by **10%**.
  
  - **Hunger & Thirst:** Increased hunger and thirst rates, as the body attempts to fight the disease. **Hunger increases 25% faster**, and **thirst increases 10% faster**.
  
  - **Fatigue:** Fatigue increases **20% faster**.
  
- **Duration:** 2 in-game days (unless cured).

- **Cure:** Blight Fever can be cured with **Herbal Poultices** or through **Magical Healing**. **Cleansing Potions** from apothecaries can also work, though they are rare and expensive.

### **Rotplague

- **Cause:** Direct exposure to infected bodies or a result of prolonged exposure to **Morkhalt's** lingering miasma. It can also be contracted through certain enemy attacks or bites.

- **Effects:**  
  
  - **Health:** Gradual health degeneration (**5% per in-game hour**), rapidly debilitating the player.
 
  - **Mana:** **Mana is entirely blocked** until the disease is cured.
 
  - **Stamina:** Severe stamina drain (**25% increase**) that can lead to unconsciousness if untreated.
  
  - **Recovery Rates:** Completely negates health and stamina recovery for the entire duration.

  - **Movement Speed:** Greatly reduced by **20%**.
 
  - **Hunger & Thirst:** **Hunger decreases at an accelerated rate**, while **thirst increases** by 50%.
 
  - **Fatigue:** The player suffers extreme **fatigue**, rendering normal actions sluggish and inefficient.
  
- **Duration:** 3 in-game days (until cured).

- **Cure:** **Magical Healing** or **Cleansing Potions** are the only means to cure this disease. It requires a powerful priest, mage, or healer that can only be found in certain regions or settlements, or through questlines.

## Disease & Interplay with Other Systems

### **Hunger, Thirst, and Fatigue**

- Diseases such as **Blight Fever** and **Food Poisoning** directly alter **Hunger** and **Thirst** rates, accelerating resource consumption and forcing players to act quickly to prevent a full depletion of their vital stats.

- **Fatigue** is often an effect of diseases  or **Blight Fever**, as the body struggles to fight off the infection. Players may find themselves needing to rest more frequently and manage their stamina, reducing their ability to travel or fight effectively.

### **Combat and Movement**

- Diseases like **Rotting Plague** can severely hinder a character's combat abilities by **blocking mana regeneration** or causing significant health drain over time. The **stamina drain** from diseases like **Food Poisoning** or **Blight Fever** makes it harder to dodge or block attacks, reducing the player’s overall combat efficiency.

- **Movement** is heavily impacted by some diseases, where the player’s mobility is either slowed or compromised. This makes travel through the world more difficult, requiring careful planning and resource management to mitigate these impacts.

### **Recovery Rates**

- Diseases slow down **health recovery** from food or rest, and in some cases, completely prevent it until the disease is treated. **Mana regeneration** and **stamina recovery** are similarly hindered, making it imperative to address these diseases quickly. Players may need to rely on specialized healing items or services from healers to recover fully.

## Conclusion

The **Disease System** in *Chronicle* is another layer of complexity in the unforgiving world of Velmoryth. Diseases don’t just impede health; they disrupt a variety of core systems, such as combat effectiveness, stamina, recovery, and even the pace of exploration. Players must balance their risks carefully—whether it's consuming questionable food, traveling through hazardous areas, or fighting infected enemies. The challenge of **[[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Preparation\|preparation]]**, **resource management**, and **tactical thinking** becomes ever more critical as players encounter these diseases, making the world of Velmoryth a place of constant threat and survival.
