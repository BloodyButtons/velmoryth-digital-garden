<center>TO STARVE, OR SURVIVE</center>

---

Hunger in *Chronicle* is more than a background timer, it’s a **vital measure** of your character’s wellbeing and a constant reminder of the harshness of the world. It tracks **how nourished** you are and has direct repercussions on [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|Health]], stamina, and your capacity to traverse Velmoryth’s demanding landscapes. Failing to stay fed will lead to **health penalties** and severe combat disadvantages.

## Core Mechanics of Hunger

1. **Separate From Attributes**  
   
   - Hunger is an independent survival stat, unaffected by STR, DEX, or other core [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Attributes Overview\|attributes]]. It ticks down gradually over time and from strenuous activities (heavy combat, long-distance travel).

2. **Maximum Health Cap**  
   
   - Prolonged hunger gradually **caps** your maximum health, representing your body’s inability to sustain full vitality. If you remain in a starved state you’ll struggle to recover, making even minor injuries more dangerous.

3. **Race-Based Consumption**  
   
   - Different races consume food (or equivalent energy sources) at varying rates.  For example, **Humans** have a moderate hunger rate- failing to eat regularly can quickly sap their strength. Meanwhile, **Elves** consume slightly less overall, reflecting a leaner metabolism, but can still starve if they neglect meals. **Mycari**, being fungal beings, rely on meditative rest and special nutrient sources though they *can* still use certain foods, they metabolize them differently.

## Interplay with Combat & Exploration

1. **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Combat Overview\|Combat]] Effectiveness**  
   
   - A starving character’s **health cap** is reduced, leaving them vulnerable in battles. They may lack the stamina to dodge or block effectively under malnourished conditions.  Offensive abilities can also feel weaker for no matter how skilled you are, hunger saps energy and focus.

2. **Long Treks & Resource Management**  
   
   - Each journey requires **careful planning** of food supplies to keep hunger at bay. If you’re traveling for days or weeks, you must bring enough rations or have a strategy for **foraging** or **hunting**. Overpacking can bog you down with encumbrance, while underpacking risks starvation mid-expedition.

2. **[[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Mapping\|Mapping]] & [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Preparation\|Preparation]]**  
   
   - When charting unknown regions, factoring in your rate of food consumption is crucial—especially if you risk venturing off main roads with fewer opportunities to resupply.  Resting at camps not only offers a chance to **draw** your map but also to *eat*, recovering from the day’s physical and mental tolls.

## Ties to Other Survival Elements

1. **Thirst & Temperature Management**  
   
   - Hunger often intertwines with [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|Thirst]], extreme dehydration eventually leading to health damage as well as a [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Mana\|Mana]] cap, and heightening fatigue.  Harsh climates, such as deserts or frozen peaks, accelerate hunger as your body burns energy regulating [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|Temperature]].

2. **Disease & Injury**  
   
   - An underfed character is more susceptible to **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|Disease]]**, with slower wound recovery. A robust supply of food ensures you can replenish nutrients lost during illness or after sustaining [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|Injuries]] in combat.

3. **Trade & Social Interactions**  
   
   - In towns or camps seeking out **provisions** becomes a priority, bargaining or trading for rare edibles can be a matter of life or death before a big expedition.  Certain NPCs might specialize in exotic rations or Mycari-friendly nutrient blends, adding depth to trading and roleplay scenarios.

## Conclusion

Hunger in *Chronicle* underscores the **harsh reality** of survival. Neglecting sustenance can stall your progress, cripple your fighting ability, and cap your maximum health. It is a grim reminder that no hero, no matter how skilled, is above the fundamental needs of the flesh (or fungal form). By linking hunger directly to health, race-based consumption rates, and the broader **exploration** mechanics, *Chronicle* ensures that managing your daily bread is as essential as honing your blade or mastering a spell, every bite of food is an investment in your survival and the key to pressing deeper into Velmoryth’s treacherous frontiers.
