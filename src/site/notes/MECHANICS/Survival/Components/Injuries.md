<center>THE CONSEQUENCES OF CARELESSNESS AND WEAKNESS</center>

---

In *Chronicle*, combat and exploration are about more than just managing a health bar. The **Injury System** adds realism, depth, and consequence to every encounter, significantly affecting survival, exploration, and combat decisions. Injuries come in two categories, **Minor** and **Major**, each with their own chances to occur and specific gameplay effects. Players must actively treat and manage these injuries to maintain optimal performance, making medical preparedness as critical as combat readiness.

---

## Minor Injuries

Minor Injuries have a **25% chance** to occur when a single strike deals at least **10% of your maximum [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|Health]]** as damage. While not immediately life-threatening, minor injuries can quickly stack up, hampering your effectiveness.

### **Small Lacerations**

- **Effect:** Minor bleeding over time.

- **Duration:** Permanent unless bandaged.

- **Impact:** Gradual health loss (.5% per minute), requiring immediate bandaging to prevent cumulative damage during exploration or extended combat scenarios.

### **Sprains**

- **Effect:** Movement speed reduced by **15%**.

- **Duration:** Permanent unless splinted.

- **Impact:** Reduced mobility makes dodging, fleeing, and navigating terrain difficult, especially dangerous during exploration or evasive combat.

### **Bruising**

- **Effect:** Provides a temporary **2.5% damage multiplier per bruise**.

- **Duration:** Lasts for 1 in-game day.

- **Impact:** Bruised characters take more damage and risk worsening injuries through continued combat engagement or misstepping during exploration.

### **Concussion**

- **Effect:** **15% visibility reduction**, 30 seconds of [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Double Vision\|Double Vision]] after impact, and **15% reduced magical damage**.

- **Duration:** 5 in-game days.

- **Impact:** Impairs spatial awareness, navigation, and magic effectiveness, complicating both combat and exploration until fully recovered.

### **Dislocated Shoulder**

- **Effect:** Reduces melee attack speed and damage output by **10%**.

- **Duration:** Permanent unless reset through a brief [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]]-draining action.

- **Impact:** Forces players to temporarily disengage from combat to reset the limb, momentarily leaving them vulnerable and affecting exploration activities requiring arm strength.

### **Minor Frostbite**

- **Effect:** Slight reduction in maximum stamina (**5%**) and reduced attack speed (**5%**).

- **Duration:** Lasts until treated with warmth or specialized ointments.

- **Impact:** Occurs primarily in cold environments, compelling players to seek warmth quickly. Persistent frostbite can complicate sustained combat and exploration in freezing conditions.

## Major Injuries

Major Injuries have an **80% chance** to occur when a strike deals at least **35% of your maximum health** as damage. These injuries dramatically alter your capabilities and require immediate and specialized treatment to avoid serious repercussions.

### **Deep Lacerations**

- **Effect:** Major bleeding, significant health drain. (1.25$ every minute)

- **Duration:** Permanent until bandaged.

- **Impact:** Rapidly drains health, making immediate medical attention essential to survival.

### **Bone Break (Leg)**

- **Effect:** **50% movement penalty** and **10% increased stamina usage**.

- **Duration:** Permanent unless splinted.

- **Impact:** Severely restricts exploration, slows travel dramatically, and compromises combat mobility and evasion.

### **Bone Break (Arm)**

- **Effect:** **25% reduced damage**.

- **Duration:** Permanent unless splinted.

- **Impact:** Decreased effectiveness in combat, pushing players to avoid melee engagements or rely heavily on alternative attack methods.

### **Burns**

- **Effect:** **20% reduced armor effectiveness** and gradual health drain.

- **Duration:** Permanent until treated with specialized ointments.

- **Impact:** Makes armor significantly less protective, escalating vulnerability in combat and forcing players to prioritize finding treatments.

### **Head Trauma**

- **Effect:** **20% reduced visibility**, **20% slower [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Mana\|Mana]] regeneration**, and **15% increased casting times**.

- **Duration:** 5 in-game days unless treated with specialized medical supplies or potions.

- **Impact:** Profoundly affects magical combat, exploration visibility, and environmental awareness. Characters must adjust strategies or seek immediate specialized healing.

### **Major Frostbite**

- **Effect:** Severe reduction in maximum stamina (**15%**) and significant penalty to attack speed and movement (**10%**).

- **Duration:** Permanent until treated with warmth and specialized treatments.

- **Impact:** Extreme cold environments quickly incapacitate players, severely hindering combat effectiveness, mobility, and overall survivability until warmth and treatment can be secured.

## Fractures (Special Cases)

Fractures are lesser forms of broken bones, sharing similar effects at half intensity (**50% of bone break penalties**). Players must still seek treatment but suffer less drastic immediate penalties.

## Injury System & Other Game Systems

The injury system deeply integrates with other survival, combat, and exploration mechanics:

Injuries compound [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|Fatigue]], [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|Hunger]], and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|Thirst]] rates, creating urgency in managing health and resources carefully. Players must strategically assess risks and benefits when deciding to engage or disengage in combat, as injuries have profound and lasting impacts. Planning exploration routes and carrying appropriate medical supplies become essential, forcing players to carefully balance resources, encumbrance, and equipment choices.

Injuries ensure every decision made during travel or combat carries lasting significance, deeply immersing players in the harsh, dangerous world of Velmoryth.
