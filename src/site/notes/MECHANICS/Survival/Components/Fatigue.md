<center>REST, FOR THE JOURNEY AHEAD</center>

---

Fatigue in *Chronicle* is the **measure of your character’s restfulness**, dictating how well they can sustain physical and mental exertion. Much like [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|Thirst]] and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|Hunger]], fatigue has **direct gameplay consequences**- especially on **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]]**, capping your maximum reserves if you fail to rest regularly. Different races handle fatigue differently, reflecting their unique physiology and sleep patterns.

##  Core Fatigue Mechanics

- **Independent Stat**  

 -  Like other [[MECHANICS/Survival/Survival Overview\|survival]] stats, Fatigue isn’t tied to Strength, Dexterity, or any other [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Attributes Overview\|attributes]].   Falling into severe fatigue **reduces your maximum stamina**, making extended battles or long treks far more punishing.

- **Racial Variation**  
  
  - Again **Humans** typically require a full night’s rest. Prolonged sleeplessness quickly saps their energy.  **Elves** are slightly more resilient, needing fewer hours to feel refreshed. **Mycari**, being fungal beings, often skip conventional sleep instead relying on **short meditations** to reset fatigue, though external conditions can influence how effective this is.

## Impact on Combat & Exploration

- **Stamina Penalties**  
  
  - A fatigued character sees their stamina pool **capped**, hindering the use of heavy attacks or long chains of dodges.  Even traveling between fights becomes more taxing, adding risk to every step in harsh environments.

- **Weakened Defenses**  
  
  - [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Blocking\|Blocking]] or [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Parrying\|Parrying]] effectively demands focus. Fatigue dulls reflexes and reaction times, making you vulnerable in skirmishes.  Prolonged fatigue can erode [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|Posture]] recovery, forcing you into passive or cautious playstyles until you rest.

- **Overland Travel & Navigation**  
  
  - Exhausted explorers cover fewer miles per day, risking more random encounters or environmental hazards.  Pushing on without sleep might lead to confusion in dense forests or treacherous highlands, compounding the challenges of survival.

## Connection to Other Survival Systems

- **Hunger & Thirst**  
  
  - Going hungry or dehydrated accelerates fatigue buildup. Your body struggles to stay active without core nutritional needs met.  Conversely, good hydration and a balanced diet slow fatigue accumulation, allowing for longer forays.

- **Temperature & Environment**  
  
  - Extreme cold or heat compounds fatigue, as your body expends extra energy regulating [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|Temperature]]. Sleeping in unsafe or suboptimal conditions (e.g., no bedroll in freezing conditions) yields minimal recovery.

- **Encumbrance & Preparedness**  
  
  - Carrying heavy gear or traveling long distances without scheduled rests drains energy fast, making fatigue a crucial element of **planning**.  Knowing where you can safely rest- like an inn, camp, or secure hideaway, becomes part of route strategizing.

## Conclusion

Fatigue in *Chronicle* underlines the **relentless reality** of travel and combat. No adventurer, regardless of raw power, can indefinitely push through sleepless nights without compromising their **stamina** and overall performance. By weaving fatigue into the world’s survival fabric alongside hunger, thirst, and environmental threats *Chronicle* ensures every player must respect the fundamental need for rest, shaping a more deliberate and immersive adventure through Velmoryth’s unforgiving landscapes.
