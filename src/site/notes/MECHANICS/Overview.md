<center>WHAT IS THE GAME I'M GOING TO MAKE?</center>

---
CHRONICLE {WORKING TITLE} is a hardcore survival RPG built in defiance of modern design trends and in reverence to the roots of the genre. It is not a game of handholding, power fantasies, or guided progression. It is a game of hardship, consequence, and discovery. Inspired by the uncompromising spirit of WoW Classic, the narrative freedom of Dungeons & Dragons, and the mystery-laden design of old-school RPGs, CHRONICLE asks only one thing of the player:

Survive. Learn. Endure. And eventually, conquer.

This is a world that does not scale to you. It will not explain itself. It will not care if you are ready. And yet, in that silence, CHRONICLE offers something rare: the chance to forge your own legend, not because the game told you to, but because you earned it.

This is a revival of the old ways, brought forward with modern fidelity. It sheds the bloat of modern RPGs, excessive UI, overbearing tutorials, endless checklist quests, and returns to something leaner, harsher, and more personal. At the same time, it brings systemic depth, narrative complexity, and emergent gameplay that reflect what RPGs can be when players are truly trusted.

There are no classes. No chosen ones. No glowing trails.

There is only you, and the world does not welcome you with open arms.

There is no assumption the player is the center of the world. Towns may live and die without you. Factions war. The dead rise. The only stories that matter are the ones you carve with your actions. The game is designed to be reactive, not predictive. It does not push you, it waits for you to push it. 

Now, let's dive into The Core Pillars of CHRONICLE; [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Exploratory Survival\|Exploratory Survival]], [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Immersion\|Immersion]], and [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Combat\|Combat]].
