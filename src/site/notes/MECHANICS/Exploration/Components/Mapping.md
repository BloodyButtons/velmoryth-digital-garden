In *Chronicle*, **mapping** is more than just a mechanic, it’s an expression of personal discovery and ownership. Rather than an automated minimap filling in by default, you must **actively document** the world around you. After a day of travel, you pause to rest, unfurling **parchment** and picking up **charcoal** to capture the **broad strokes** of the landscape: mountains, rivers, stretches of forest, and prominent landmarks like towering spires or yawning canyons.

However, the **finer details** are left entirely to you. **Trails, hidden tombs, backroad hazards,** and **unofficial travel routes** don’t appear automatically, so if you stumble upon a secluded crypt deep in The Silent Plains, **you** decide whether and how to mark it. One explorer might sketch a carefully annotated path that winds through **The Hungering Ridge**, mapping every ridge line and clearing between **The Verdant Ruin** and **The Gloam Mire**, while another might record only vague references, leaving giant swaths of the page empty and uncharted. This freedom fosters a **sense of ownership**- each map is a testament to *your* experiences and *your* priorities.

By keeping the process **retroactive**, revealing new terrain only once you settle down to draw, *Chronicle* preserves the **thrill of venturing into the unknown**. You hold your findings in memory or personal notes until safe enough to pause and commit them to paper. This ritual anchors exploration in tangible, **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Survival Overview\|survival]]-minded** gameplay: plotting out new routes, logging natural obstacles, or marking lurking dangers. Ultimately, mapping becomes an **[[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Immersion\|immersive]] record** of your journey across Velmoryth’s shifting wilds, reflecting every risk you’ve taken and every wonder you’ve uncovered. And of course, should you have the means, you can always purchase maps ahead of time.
