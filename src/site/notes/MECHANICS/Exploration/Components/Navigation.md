<center>TO BE A WAYFINDER</center>

---

In *Chronicle*, **navigation** is grounded in tangible methods of orientation chief among them **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Compasses\|Compasses]]** and relies heavily on **landmarks** for those who lack detailed maps. This design pulls players out of automated wayfinding, demanding careful observation and engagement with the natural world. Where “[[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/fast travel\|fast travel]]” is minimal and map updates aren’t automatic, navigation becomes a **core facet** of your adventure rather than a mere background function.

##  A Compass & Landmark Orientation

- **Compass Usage**:  
  
  - Every adventurer can carry a basic compass for directional guidance. It keeps you aligned north, south, east, or west but offers no specifics beyond that bearing.  In regions without major landmarks like featureless plains or rolling deserts, this *simple pointer* might be your only anchor to reality when storms or darkness set in.

- **Landmark Reliance**:  
  
  - Spotting and memorizing visible points in the distance like tall peaks, colossal ruins, or towering monoliths lets you triangulate your position.  You might see a distinctive stone spire in the far horizon an NPC mentioned in an earlier conversation and use it to confirm your compass heading, ensuring you don’t drift off course.

##  Interplay with Mapping

- **Transitioning from Memory to Paper**:  
  
  - While traveling, you rely on **compass** readings and major geographical references. Once you rest, you can mark them on your **map** expanding your known routes.  As your map becomes more complete, route-planning feels more intuitive, reducing guesswork for future expeditions.

- **Discovering New Landmarks**:  
  
  - If you spot an uncharted tower or alien obelisk, you might use your map notes to link it with known locations forming a mental chain of navigational “bread crumbs.”  Omission or forgetfulness in mapping these landmarks can lead to confusion or unexpected detours, especially when the environment shifts or visibility is poor.

## The Significance for Overworld Travel

- **Limited “Fast Travel”**:  
  
  - With minimal fast travel options, crossing Velmoryth’s wilds demands *actual navigation skills*. The game’s design ensures each leg of the journey remains meaningful and tense. A well-used compass can keep you on track, but environmental hazards or illusions might still confound your bearings.

- **Survival & Preparedness**:  
  
  - Venturing across unknown terrain means balancing your **resources**. Food, water, warmth are vital knowing you might be off-course if your navigation falters. The synergy with [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Preparation\|Preparation]] is evident: you pack enough supplies for the expected journey, but misjudging direction extends travel time and risks running out.

- **Environmental Variation**:  
  
  - Mountain passes, dense forests, ashen wastes, or wind-swept deserts each present different challenges, your compass might be reliable, but swirling ash or thick fog can obscure landmarks. Learning each region’s quirks fosters mastery and confidence in your sense of direction.

## Ties to Other Gameplay Systems

- **Combat & Encounters**:  
  
  - While forging your path, you may stumble into ambushes or monstrous lairs you didn’t know existed. Good navigation (and well-annotated maps) can help you circumvent dangerous territories if you’re low on supplies or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]].

- **Stamina & Posture**:  
 
  - Winding detours or getting lost prolong your travel, upping the odds of fatigue and [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|Posture]] damage once you face threats at your destination. Thorough planning of your route keeps you from unnecessarily exhausting yourself en route.

- **[[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Immersion\|Immersion]] & Role-Playing**:  
  
  - Relying on a compass and vantage-based orientation intensifies the **first-person** sense of truly being an explorer. Marking new points of interest yourself highlights your character’s personal **knowledge** of Velmoryth’s geography.
