Chronicle abandons traditional skill trees in favour of **diegetic learning** ([[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Instructors\|instructors]] and practice) and **organic recognition** ([[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]] that awaken automatically).

Power growth always feeds the living world: each advance nudges **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]]** upward, which in turn scales enemy threat *and* improves loot quality after each 24 h cycle.

## Active Skills

| Step | Mechanic | Key Rules |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Learn** | Visit a specialist **Instructor**. | • Pays in Writs *(currency tiers handled in Economy chapter)*.<br>• Must meet the attribute gate.<br>• Instructor may grant a **one-time +2** to their governing attribute. |
| **Practice** | First 50 combat uses carry a 5-10 % miss / backfire chance (spells cause self-damage, never lethal). | Training dummies halve fail chance but give **0 XP**. |
| **Rank-Up** | Rank 0 → 4 via combat XP. | • Fail chance shrinks each rank; 0 % at Rank 3.<br>• Rank 3 unlocks one of two **Modifier Runes** (skill morphs). |
| **Points** | Each skill grants **20 pts** to hidden *[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Skill Level\|Skill Level]]*; equipping the 12th skill adds +10. | Skill Level hard-cap **250**. |

### Skill Classes & Governing Attributes

| Class (Active)  | Attribute |

## Passive Talents

*No menus, no purchases.*  The engine checks prerequisites every time you **Rest**.

| Condition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Attribute ≥ gate | STR 10 |
| Related Skills ≥ threshold | 2 Tower-Shield skills |

If both true, the talent “wakes up,” the player sees a **dream vignette + on-screen toast**, and the talent becomes selectable at the next rest site / instructor.

* **Slots** : up to **12 talents** can be equipped (free swap in safe areas).  

* **Points** : 20 pts each +10 bonus at 12/12 ⇒ *[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Talent Level\|Talent Level]]* cap **250**.  

* **Dual-Function nodes** (~2 %) apply a passive buff and* morph a linked skill.

## Instructor Network

| Tier | Rank Cap Taught | Attribute Boost | Typical Location |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Apprentice  | Rank 1 | +2 (once) | Village dojo, militia yard |
| Journeyman  | Rank 2 | +2 (once) | Border forts, guild huts |
| Master      | Rank 3 | +2 (once) | Capital academies, cult crypts |
| Grandmaster | Rank 4 + Rune | +2 (once) | Hidden sanctums (one per class) |

*Instructors drop explicit hints about their higher-tier counterparts once befriended.*

##  Feedback & Timing

| Trigger          | Player Feedback                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Talent unlock    | Dream sequence + **toast:** “Talent Available - Bulwark”            |
| World Level rise | Rest screen vignette + **toast** “The World Grows Stronger (WL +1)” |

*World Level can rise **once per 24 in-game hours** at rest.*  

Higher WL increases enemy stats *and* elevates dungeon/loot tier, counter-balancing the difficulty spike.

---

##  Discovery Loop

* **Lorebooks & NPC Rumours** give exact travel clues (“Blademaster Amarii camps two days east of Lasthearth”).  

* **No global skill menu** - players keep personal notes or piece together maps from gossip.  

* This deliberate density reinforces Chronicle’s “not on autopilot” ethos; attentiveness is power.

---

## Example Progression

> **Goal**: become a *Spellsword* (Bulwark + Frost magic).

1. Learn *One-Hand Slash* (Martial) from an Apprentice Blades instructor – cost: 1 Tin Writ.  

2. Find Journeyman Arcanist; pay 1 Iron Writ – acquire *Frost Spike* (Destruction).  

3. Practice both until Rank 2 (fail rate gone).  

4. STR 6 and INT 8 now meet the hidden gate → **Talent toast** “Spellsword Available”.  

5. At next rest, equip Spellsword (+10 % sword dmg, +10 % spell power). WL bumps +1; better loot appears in subsequent delves.

### Design Intention Recap

* *Risk-Practice-Mastery* for every new skill.  

* Talents feel like the world acknowledging your growth, not a checklist.  

* Instructor hunts create organic side-quests and justify exploration.  

* WL gating and loot counter-scaling keep the difficulty curve fair but relentless.  

Players who observe, plan, and travel will wield bespoke builds; those who ignore the world’s whispers will remain ordinary, and Chronicle makes no apology for the difference.
