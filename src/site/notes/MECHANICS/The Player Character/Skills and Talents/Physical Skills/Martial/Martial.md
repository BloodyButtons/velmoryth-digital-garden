<center>STEEL SPEAKS LOUDER THAN WORDS</center>

---

Pure, relentless offence.  Martial fighters close distance, break armour, and shatter [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|posture]] with deliberate, [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]]-hungry swings.  There are **no [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Defensive/Defensive\|defensive]] maneuvers** in this discipline; [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Blocking\|blocking]], [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Parrying\|parrying]], and armour specialisation live in the Defensive class.

### Grandmaster - *“The Brood” of Forsaken Ascent*

* Trial: **Honour duel** on a wind-scoured cliff.  
* Reward:  
  * **Rank-4 skill**: *Sundering Lunge* – long thrust, halves armour 5 s.  
  * **Rune**: *Crusher Wave* (if not already owned).  
  * **Signature Boon**: *Heart of Iron* – permanent +3 % stamina regen while any Martial weapon is equipped.

Defeat = knock-back off cliff; respawn at campfire below, may climb and rematch indefinitely.

### Progression Example

1. Player starts with a rusty longsword → gains **Cleave**.  
2. Lands 100 Cleaves; instructor hint directs to Gloamsrest.  
3. STR raises from 6 → 8 via combat; buys **Sweeping Cleave**.  
4. Promotes mentor, gains +2 STR (now 10), unlocks Tier-2 **Great Cleave**.  
5. [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]] bumps on rest; loot table rises.  
6. Pilgrimage to Forsaken Ascent, defeats Brood, learns *Sundering Lunge* and gains *Heart of Iron*.  
7. Build identity achieved: colossal great-axe + high regen burst-breaker.

Martial thus delivers a linear, offence-only fantasy that rewards commitment to big weapons and punishes sloppy [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Stamina Management\|stamina management]]—while dovetailing cleanly with Chronicle’s exploration-centric instructor network and Strength-through-practice progression.
