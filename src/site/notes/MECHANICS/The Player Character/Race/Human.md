<center>JACK OF ALL TRADES, MASTERS OF NONE</center>

---
## Race Sheet

Versatile, short-lived, and intensely curious, Humans never specialised the way elder races did.  
Instead they refined **adaptability** into an art—learning faster, blending foreign traditions into their own, and thriving in every climate from the Shroudway dunes to the Sister Mountains’ passes.

| Base Array | Survival Profile | Signature Perks | Drawbacks |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **STR 4  DEX 4  INT 4  FTH 4  VIT 4  REF 4  MIN 4** | • Hunger / Thirst / Fatigue decay at standard rates.  • Neutral to heat and cold; rely on gear for extremes. | • **Adaptive Learners** — gain **+10 % Skill-XP** in every Skill Class.  • **Cultural Syncretist** — may adopt **one** non-Drake racial Talent at a *Rite of Bonding* shrine (permanent). | • No innate damage resistances or environmental bonuses.  • Choice of foreign talent is irreversible; Draconic talents banned. |

### System Synergy

| Loop          | Human Edge                                           |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classless Buildcraft** | Balanced attributes mean fewer Attribute-gate cliffs; can pivot between martial, finesse, or arcane builds with minimal respec costs. |
| **Skill Progression**    | +10 % XP compounds with *use-to-improve*: Humans unlock 20-point Skill thresholds sooner (early Talents, faster Combat tricks). |
| **Difficulty Curve**     | Faster Skill gain nudges Character Level—and therefore World Level—slightly earlier; players must balance learning sprees with gear upgrades. |
| **Encumbrance / Survival** | Neutral metabolism keeps inventory light (no extra food like Dwarves or fuel like Machinations). |

### Cultural Syncretist

| Talent Source  | Talent Name        | Mechanical Benefit                                 | Typical Build Synergy |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Dwarf**      | *Stoneborn*        | +10 Max HP, +10 % Cold Resist                      | Heavy-armor tanks, frost expeditions |
| **Elf**        | *Fleetstep*        | +5 DEX, –10 % footstep noise                       | Stealth archers, Illusionists |
| **Mycari**     | *Spore Regrowth*   | 0.2 HP/sec regen in Dim or Dark                    | Dungeon crawlers, Necromancers |
| **Undead**     | *Nightwalk*        | Sunlight burn rate −50 %                           | Day-roaming death-knights |
| **Machination**| *Schematic Mind*   | +5 MIN, +5 % Max MP                                | Psionicists, rune-smiths |

*Adoption Rite*: performed at a regional shrine with 1 Blood-Shard + 100 MP; drains 15 HP, locks choice forever.

### Survival & Exploration Interplay

* **Mapping & Landmarking** — average DEX and MIN yield steady hand for charcoal maps and reliable memory checks; not best-in-class but never gated.  
* **Temperature Neutrality** — flexible cloak rotation (fur for cold, linen for dunes) without racial over- or under-penalties.  
* **Rest Routine** — standard fatigue curve matches Bedroll design; no trance cycles or maintenance windows to schedule around.

### Combat Applications

| Archetype          | Attribute Spread        | Notes |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| **Battle Mage**    | STR 8  DEX 8  INT 12    | Early Destruction + swordplay; adopt *Stoneborn* for HP cushion or *Fleetstep* for mobility. |
| **Shadow Ranger**  | DEX 14  REF 9           | Stealth bow + Throw Voice; foreign *Fleetstep* noise bonus stacks with Sneak Talents. |
| **Holy Commander** | STR 10  FTH 12  VIT 9   | Invocation buff tank; combine with *Stoneborn* or *Nightwalk* to offset heat-of-battle exposure. |

### Balance Notes

Humans are the baseline: no innate resistances, but no crippling weaknesses.  

Their Adaptive Learner perk can raise World Level faster—encouraging mindful pacing—while Cultural 

Syncretist provides a single, meaningful flavour twist without eclipsing the original race’s theme.

> **Design Intent:** Humans are the “wildcard” choice—  
> never best at any one pillar, but always *good enough* to survive, adapt, and eventually excel through skill, gear, and one carefully-chosen foreign legacy.
