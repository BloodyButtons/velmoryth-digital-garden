## Race Sheet

| Base Array | Survival Profile | Signature Perks | Drawbacks |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **STR 5  DEX 5  INT 8  FTH 4  VIT 6  REF 4  MIN 8** | • No [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|hunger]], [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|thirst]], or sleep.  • **Photosynthetic Meditation** every 48 h (12‑h trance).  • High susceptibility to both Heat and Cold (±30 % temp thresholds). | • **Spore Anchor**: meditation spot becomes a personal respawn node; leaves glowing fungal ring visible to party.  • **Asexual Regrowth**: after fatal blow, 30 % chance to auto‑revive at Spore Anchor with 20 % HP (12‑h cooldown).  • **Toxin Affinity**: immune to normal poisons & diseases. | • [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|Temperature]] swing damage +30 %.  • Cannot wear Full Helmets (cap obstructs).  • 12‑hr trance leaves body immobile—perfect prey for ambush. |

### Photosynthetic Meditation Cycle

* **Trigger** - Every 48 in‑game hours, [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]] meter caps at 50 %. Only Meditation restores it.  

* **Mechanics** - Entering trance plants a **Spore Anchor** (radius 2 m). Emits faint light, acts as a *rest location*. 

* **Benefits** - Restores HP, MP, SP to full; grants +10 % [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]] regen and +5 % MP regen for the next 6 h (“Fresh Bloom”).  

* **Risks** - Unconscious for one in-game day. Foes can burn anchors (torch, fire spell) destroying the respawn link or even attack the player, interrupting meditation.

- **Multiplayer** - As with sleeping, players can set the amount of rest taken for a % of the full effect. This allows for Mycari to rest as well as other player races without affecting multiplayer structure.

Humans with the **Asceticism** talent replicate the trance (18 h requirement, no Spore Anchor, no toxin immunity).

### System Interactions

| System        | Mycari Impact                               |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Survival Loop | No food/water simplifies inventory, but photosynthesis anchor forces planned routes; cold/hot zones require Emberwine + Frostmead rotation. |
| Exploration   | Spore Anchors create **safe waypoints** deep in dungeons; map auto‑annotates anchor sites. |
| Combat        | Immune to [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Bleed\|Bleed]] & [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|Disease]] reduces medical supply load; fire damage +20 % offsets this. |
| Crafting      | Fungal reagents harvested from own Anchor (+1 rare “Glow Spores” per trance) used in Greater Poultice recipes. |

### Breathing & Temperature Penalties

* **Cold**: at –10 °C, Stamina drain +25 %, HP tick 0.5 HP/sec.  
* **Heat**: at 35 °C, HP tick 0.5 HP/sec, Meditation cooldown extended +6 h (sun scorch).  
* *Mitigation*: Two‑slot cloak layering (Fur + Cooling Weave) cuts both penalties by half, but increases [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]].

### Sample Builds

| Build                   | Key Stats            | Notes |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Spore Savant** (Staff + Psionic) | MIN 12 / INT 10 | Anchor‑based respawn encourages glass‑cannon casting; [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Mind\|Mind]] perks amplify MP pool. |
| **Toxin Ranger** (Bow + Acid arrows) | DEX 10 / INT 11 | Immune to [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Poison\|poison]] clouds; craft Venom Tinctures from glow spores for extra arrow DoT. |
| **Verdant Guardian** (Halberd + Stoneskin) | STR 9 / VIT 8 | Uses Stamina regen buff post‑trance to hold choke points; beware fire‑wielding foes. |

### World‑Level & Balance Notes

The anchor revive and poison immunity could trivialise early challenges; however, forced 12‑minute vulnerability and strong elemental [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Weakness\|weakness]] keep Mycari death‑aversion on par with other races. Spore Anchors do **not** raise [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Character Level\|Character Level]] but count as additional “[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Rest Locations\|rest locations]],” easing exploration pacing without inflating world difficulty.

### Role‑Play Hooks

* **Fading Custodians** – NPC Mycari druid circles seek to regreen barren biomes; player anchors may trigger local flora resurgence events.  
* **Spores of Memory** – Destroyed anchors drop “Faded Mycelia” collectables used to craft psychedelic [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Illusionism/Illusion\|Illusion]] potions.  
* **Clan‑less Wanderers** – Mycari PCs often negotiate with Dwarves for brewing warmth draughts or with Elves for anti‑fire runes.

Mycari stand apart: **no hunger, no sleep, no disease—yet tethered to long, vulnerable trances and crucified by temperature swings.** Their play‑loop rewards planning, anchor placement, and creative use of toxin immunity, making them a strategic boon to any expedition, provided allies guard the mushroom while it dreams under cold stars.
