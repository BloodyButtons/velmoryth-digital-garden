<center>MORKHALT'S ROAMING CORRUPTION</center>

---

## Race Sheet

Spawned when Morkhalt’s corruption seeped into the soil, the Undead are rare revenants who clawed back full sentience—often after dark rites.  By day they smolder beneath the sun; by night they haunt roads and ruins, shunned by nearly every settlement.

| Base Array                                          | Survival Profile                                                | Signature Perks                                                                                                     | Drawbacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Solar Scourge Mechanic

| Exposure Duration\* | Effect                                    | Mitigation                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0 - 15 s            | Skin smolders; −1 HP/s                    | Hood, mask, gloves reduce tick by 50 %. |
| 15 - 30 s           | Flesh ignites; −3 HP/s                    | Shadow Mantle [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Illusionism/Illusion\|Illusion]] halves tick.     |
| 30 s +              | Bones char; −6 HP/s + −50 % [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]] regen | No mitigation- seek shade or die.       |

\*Clock pauses in full shade, resets after 3 min darkness.

### Disguise & Social [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Stealth\|Stealth]]

| Disguise Quality | Components Needed            | NPC Reaction Modifier                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low**          | Hood + Mask                  | −25 Hostility; guards still demand bribes.                |
| **Moderate**     | Hood + Mask + Light Veil     | −50 Hostility; merchants trade but charge ×1.5.           |
| **High**         | Full [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Robes\|Robes]] + Illusion “Veil” | Treated as normal humanoid unless Holy detection is cast. |

Breaking disguise (combat, knock-back removing hood, Holy reveal) triggers immediate aggression.

### System Interactions

* **Survival Loop** - freed inventory (no food/water/bedroll) offsets need to pack multiple cloaks or Illusion scrolls for sun travel.  

* **Stealth & Night Play** - natural darkness lowers enemy vision cones; Undead often tackle dungeons at dusk to avoid solar risk.  

* **Holy Weakness** - party formation matters: stand backline vs. paladins, exploit immunity to poison traps instead.  

* **Waterborne Tactics** - unlimited breath enables underwater flanking routes, treasure dives, or river escapes other races can’t match.

### Sample Builds

| Build            | Key Gear / Stats                        | Notes                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shade Blade**  | DEX 10, REF 8 — Daggers + Illusion Veil | Ambush at dusk, vanish before dawn; sun cloak mandatory.   |
| **Crypt Archer** | DEX 12, INT 8 — Crossbow + Acid bolts   | Snipe from shadowy perches; underwater retreats.           |
| **Grave Hexer**  | INT 10, MIN 9 — Necromancy + Frost      | Raise minions immune to daylight; travel via sewer routes. |

### World-Level & Balance Notes

No metabolic costs shrink Character-Level tempo, yet Holy vulnerability and daylight hazard keep death risk high.  Skilled players schedule travel windows, turning Undead into meticulous planners rather than perpetual roamers.

---

### Narrative Hooks

* **Sun-Forge Censure** - paladin orders post bounties for “rogue cadavers”; high-level Holy hunts spawn if Undead PCs over-harvest villages at night.  

* **Remembrance Rites** - buried memory shards let an Undead briefly see past life, granting random skill XP.  

* **Unholy Conversion** - Humans may sacrifice their racial slot to become Undead via the “Nightfall Covenant” ritual, inheriting all strengths and weaknesses.

Undead play the ultimate **high-risk, high-planning** archetype: impervious to time and plague, yet forever an ember’s breath from incineration under the merciless sun.  Master the shadows, cloak the rot, and the night becomes your refuge- until dawn.
