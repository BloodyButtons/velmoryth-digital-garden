Throwing Weapons in *Chronicle* bridge the gap between **melee agility** and **ranged opportunism**. Falling under the **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Finesse/Finesse\|Finesse]]** category, these weapons scale primarily with **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]**, but unlike standard Finesse weapons, they also belong to the **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Ranged/Ranged\|Ranged]] Skill Line**, sharing [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]] and mechanics with bows and crossbows.

These tools excel in **quick, reactive combat**, **ambushes**, and **tactical utility**, allowing players to inflict damage or disrupt enemies without engaging in prolonged combat. Whether you're a nimble rogue peppering foes with throwing knives, or a saboteur veiling your escape in smoke, Throwing Weapons offer flexible tools for battlefield control.

## Talent & Skill Synergy

Throwing Weapons are enhanced by talents from both the **Finesse** and **Ranged** talent trees. Key talents might include:

- **Quickdraw** – Reduces throwing time and increases damage.
- **Marked Target** – Landing a thrown weapon highlights the enemy, increasing follow-up damage.
- **Silent Volley** – Increases crit chance on thrown weapons used from stealth.
- **Alchemical Slinger** – Enhances the effects of firebombs or smoke bombs via the Alchemy skill.

Additionally, **Reflex-based talents** can complement thrown weapon builds by increasing mobility, evasion, and [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Critical Windows\|critical windows]] after a successful throw.
