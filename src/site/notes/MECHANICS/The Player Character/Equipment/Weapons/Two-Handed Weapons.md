Two-handed weapons in *Chronicle* break down into **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Martial/Martial\|Martial]]** (Strength-based) and **Versatile** (mixed [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]/[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]) classes, each carrying its own attributes and skill unlocks. Where a **Greataxe** or **Warhammer** offers colossal strikes at the cost of mobility, a **Spear** or **Quarterstaff** blends technique with power, catering to hybrid builds. Furthermore, certain racial abilities (notably [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Race/Machination\|Machinations]], or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Race/Human\|Humans]] with a specialized racial talent) allow wielding some two-handed Martial weapons in **one hand**, pairing them with a shield- like a fearsome Tower Shield, for unstoppable force.

## Martial (Strength-Based)

These weapons specialize in **overwhelming force** and **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|posture]]-breaking** potential. They demand high Strength thresholds and excel in direct, punishing assaults.

### Weapon Descriptions

**Greatswords**  

- Long, heavy blades typically spanning four to five feet.  

- Emphasize sweeping arcs and devastating overhead swings.  

- Excellent for cleaving multiple foes or smashing through a single target’s posture.

**Greataxes**  

- Huge, broad axe heads designed for raw chopping power.  

- Inflict high damage per strike, slower swing speeds.  

- Can maim [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]] or break shields, punishing low-[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]] opponents.

**Warhammers / Mauls**  

- Massive blunt weapons with weighted heads (metal for warhammers, dense iron or stone for mauls).  

- Devastating impact, crippling posture on direct hits.  

- Especially effective against heavily plated foes, though they’re unwieldy in close quarters.

  
### Visual Table (Martial Two-Handed)

| Weapon             | STR Requirement | Damage Profile       | Attack Speed  | Notes                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Greatsword**     | ~15–25 STR      | High slash/thrust    | Moderate-slow | Large arcs, good crowd control, synergy w/ wide combos   |
| **Greataxe**       | ~18–25 STR      | Very high chop       | Slow          | Big single-hit damage, punishing overhead strikes        |
| **Warhammer/Maul** | ~18–25 STR      | Blunt, armor-shatter | Slow          | Top-tier posture break, can flatten heavily armored foes |

  ---
### Use Cases (Martial)

- **Juggernaut Frontliner**  
  High Strength, often [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]] synergy. Wields a **greatsword** or **greataxe** to annihilate clusters of enemies or bust through a shield wall.

- **Crippling Tank**  
  A **warhammer** user with [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Heavy Armor\|heavy armor]], aiming to stunlock foes’ posture. Each overhead smash can disrupt entire enemy lines if timed with stamina drains.

- **Machinations or Specialized Strength Talents**  
  Some characters may hold these massive weapons in **one hand**, combining unstoppable force with a Tower Shield. This typically requires advanced or racial [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]], turning them into near-literal walking walls.

---

## Versatile (Strength + Dexterity)

[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Weapons/Versatile Weapons\|Versatile weapons]] scale off both **Strength** and **Dexterity**, allowing hybrid builds to combine raw power with technique. They’re suited to mid-range or agile fighters who can pivot between blocking and maneuvering.

  
### Weapon Descriptions

**Spears or Halberds**  

- Long-reaching polearms, combining thrusts and slashes.  

- Great for zone control, poking from a safe distance.  

- Dex amplifies precision while STR adds heavier hits.

**Quarterstaves**  

- Simple rods of hardened wood or metal inlay.  

- Allows for swift combos, decent reach, minimal encumbrance.  

- Perfect for minimal-armor skirmishers or cunning mages bridging melee.


  
### Visual Table (Versatile Two-Handed)

| Weapon            | STR/DEX Requirement | Damage/Style                 | Attack Tempo  | Notes                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spear/Halberd** | ~12–18 STR & Dex    | Thrust/polearm slash         | Moderate      | Excellent reach; synergy with mid-line defenders or agile soldiers        |
| **Quarterstaff**  | ~10–15 STR & Dex    | Balanced blunt combos        | Fast-moderate | Low weight, good for staff-based illusions or mage-fighter builds         |

  ---
### Use Cases (Versatile)

- **Spear & Mobility**  
  Characters bridging moderate Strength and Dexterity. Keep distance with thrusts, advanced footwork. Good for [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Medium Armor\|medium armor]] synergy.

- **Staff Combat Mage**  
  A spellcaster invests partial STR/DEX for staff-based melee, weaving illusions or conjurations with close-range combos.

---

## Racial & Talent Intricacies

- **Machinations** or Men with Racial Talent  
  May hold a **Martial two-hander** in one hand, letting them equip a Tower Shield. This extreme synergy requires advanced STR or specialized racial feats, turning them into unstoppable fortresses.

- **Strength Talents**  
  Eventually let non-Machination characters wield two-handed Martial weapons in one hand, though far later in their progression.

- **Skill Classes (Martial & Versatility)**  
  Provide combos, overhead slashes, or special zone control attacks once STR/DEX thresholds are met.  
  Talents might grant faster recovery frames for quarterstaffs, or swirling cleave combos for greataxes.

---

## Summary

Two-handed weapons split between **Martial** and **Versatile** categories, shaping distinct playstyles:

- **Martial** (Greatsword, Greataxe, Warhammer/Maul) revolve around **massive Strength** for lethal overheads and brutal posture breaks.

- **Versatile** (Spears/Halberds, Quarterstaves) blend Strength and Dexterity, suiting hybrid or agile tank builds who want lengthier reach, fluid combos, or unique synergy in footwork and damage.

From unstoppable **Greataxe** juggernauts cleaving entire lines of foes to nimble **Quarterstaff** mages who pivot between illusions and staff strikes, two-handed weapons in *Chronicle* offer high stakes and high reward for those who invest in the necessary attributes and harness corresponding talents. Whether you crush armor or dance around threats with spear combos, these weapons shape how you dominate or adapt to Velmoryth’s dangerous battlefields.
