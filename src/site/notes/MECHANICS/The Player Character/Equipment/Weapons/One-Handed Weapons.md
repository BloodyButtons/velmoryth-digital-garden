One-handed weapons in *Chronicle* blend **offensive [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Versatility/Versatility\|versatility]]** with **mobility**, letting characters wield a **shield**, **off-hand focus**, or **dual-wield** another light weapon in the other hand. They subdivide into two main categories, **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Martial/Martial\|Martial]]** ([[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]-based) and **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Finesse/Finesse\|Finesse]]** ([[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]-based), each scaling off different attributes and unlocking unique skill sets once certain thresholds are reached. Below is an overview of these weapon types, their use cases, and synergy with *Chronicle*’s skill classes and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]].

## Martial Weapons (Strength-Based)

Martial one-handers (maces, longswords, axes) rely on **raw power** to smash or slice through foes. They demand moderate to high **Strength (STR)** for optimal damage, [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|posture]]-breaking, and synergy with **Martial** skill class abilities.

---
### Weapon Descriptions

- **Maces**  

  • Metal or studded head affixed to a short handle  

  • Delivers **blunt force** damage, favoring posture destruction and concussive hits  

  • Suited to tankier builds or those specializing in heavy striking talents

- **Longswords**  

  • A versatile cutting and thrusting blade, typically ~3-4 feet in total length  

  • Balanced speed and damage, bridging agile combos and forceful blows  

  • Often used by knightly or mid-STR characters seeking flexible offense

- **Axes**  

  • A broad metal head with a sharp edge for cleaving  

  • Emphasizes **heavy strikes** that carve into [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]] and hamper foes’ posture  

  • Can be single-bladed or double-bladed; higher STR yields more lethal overhead chops

### Visual Data (Martial One-Handed)

| Weapon        | Typical STR Requirement | Damage Profile        | Posture Break Potential    | Notes                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mace**      | 10–15 STR               | Blunt, medium damage  | High vs. heavily armored{} | Great for staggering or smashing skeletons           |
| **Longsword** | 12–18 STR               | Balanced slash/thrust | Moderate                   | Ideal bridging speed & force, staple knight’s choice |
| **Axe**       | 12–18 STR               | High-impact slash     | High                       | Slower swing than sword, but potent overheads        |

  ---
### Use Cases

- **Bruiser Frontliners**  
  Wield an **axe** or **mace** with a shield, focusing on powerful overhead strikes and posture-break combos.

- **Knightly Generalist**  
  Opt for a **longsword** for balanced offense—capable of quick cuts or thrusts. [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Medium Armor\|Medium armor]] synergy suits moderate Strength users well.

- **Tank-Support**  
  Some STR-based characters rely on a **mace** to handle blunt damage while wearing [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Heavy Armor\|heavy armor]], bridging crowd control with raw defense.

## Finesse Weapons (Dexterity-Based)

Finesse one-handers (shortswords, daggers, rapiers) revolve around **speed**, **precision**, and **nimble combos**. They scale with **Dexterity (DEX)**, unlocking abilities from the **Finesse** skill class. High Reflex synergy also amplifies critical hits or parry windows with these weapons.

---
  
### Weapon Descriptions

- **Shortswords**  
  • Compact blades with ~2–2.5 ft length  
  • Balanced between speed and moderate damage  
  • Good for dual-wielding or pairing with a buckler for quick parry/counter

- **Daggers**  
  • Lightweight, extremely fast stabbing or slashing tools  
  • Low base damage but **excellent crit potential**, especially with high Reflexes  
  • Ideal for stealth kills, backstabs, or dual-wield combos

- **Rapiers**  
  • Slim, thrust-oriented blades specialized in **precision**  
  • High crit rate potential, moderate damage, swift recovery frames  
  • Perfect for Dex-based duelists or parry-centric fighters

---  
### Visual Data (Finesse One-Handed)

| Weapon      | Typical DEX Requirement | Damage Profile       | Crit Potential        | Notes                                              |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Shortsword** | 10–15 DEX              | Moderate slash/thrust | Medium                | Common, decent speed, pairs well with a buckler    |
| **Dagger**     | ~10 DEX               | Low base damage       | High                  | Very fast attacks; thrives on Reflex-based crit windows |
| **Rapier**     | 15–20 DEX             | Precise thrust        | Very High             | Parry-oriented duels, strong critical synergy, minimal slash |

 --- 
### Use Cases

- **Stealth & Ambush**  
  **Daggers** excel in close-quarters infiltration, backstabbing, or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Stealth\|Stealth]] kills. High Reflex synergy yields swift lethal combos.

- **Mobile Duelist**  
  **Rapiers** let a fencer exploit critical hits, focusing on tight parry windows. [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Light Shields\|Light shields]] or orbs in the off-hand accentuate agility.

- **Balanced Skirmisher**  
  **Shortswords** serve Dex-based builds seeking a compromise of speed and damage, often pairing with minimal armor and strong dodge frames.

---

## Skill Classes, Thresholds & Talents

Meeting attribute thresholds (e.g., STR 15+ for advanced Martial or DEX 15+ for advanced Finesse) unlocks specialized combos and talents:

- **Martial** skill lines: Overhead slams, shield-based bashes, or armor-penetrating swings.

- **Finesse** skill lines: Quick multi-hit flurries, counter-attacks, or advanced parries. Reflex talents can further expand critical timing windows.

  
Talents might include:

- **Cleave** (Martial): High STR requirement to deliver a wide-arc strike hitting multiple foes.

-  **Flurry** (Finesse): String together successive thrusts or slashes with minimal downtime, triggered at Dex 15+ or so.

-  **Counter Parry** (Reflex synergy): Lethal ripostes after a successful block or parry, bridging Dex and Reflex builds.

## Summary

One-handed weapons in *Chronicle* maintain a **balance** of offensive capability and battlefield mobility:

• **Martial** (maces, longswords, axes) tie to **Strength**, shining in up-close slugfests, posture damage, and synergy with heavy or medium armor.

• **Finesse** (shortswords, daggers, rapiers) tie to **Dexterity**, rewarding precision combos, critical strikes, and synergy with more agile or stealth-oriented builds.

From the brutal force of a **mace** swinging through an armored foe to the pinpoint precision of a **rapier** in a duelist’s hand, these one-handers complement a broad spectrum of [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Combat\|combat]] playstyles and highlight *Chronicle*’s classless approach to **attribute-based** mastery.
