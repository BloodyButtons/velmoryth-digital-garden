[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Ranged/Ranged\|Ranged]] weapons in *Chronicle* exist in their own distinct category, diverging from standard [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Martial/Martial\|Martial]] or Versatile archetypes. Though they technically fall under the **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Versatility/Versatility\|Versatility]]** umbrella due to their dual scaling with **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]** and **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]**, they follow a unique skill path known as the **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Ranged/Ranged\|Ranged]] Skill Line**. This line unlocks abilities and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]] through **combined attribute thresholds**, rewarding characters who balance force and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Finesse/Finesse\|finesse]]. Whether you're a long-range sharpshooter, a silent hunter, or a mobile skirmisher, bows and crossbows offer distinct playstyles tied deeply to *Chronicle*’s core pillars of **[[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Combat\|Combat]]**, **Survival**, and **Exploration**.

## Ranged Skill Scaling

Ranged weapons scale off the **sum** of Strength and Dexterity. While some skills favor one stat over the other (i.e., quickshots favor DEX, piercing bolts favor STR), **combined thresholds** allow a variety of builds to access powerful ranged options.

• A character with **10 STR and 10 DEX** can access skills requiring a threshold of 20.  
• Likewise, **6 STR and 14 DEX** still satisfies the requirement—offering build flexibility.

This flexible system allows for:
- **Balanced hybrid builds**  
- **Heavily DEX-leaning archers**  
- **STR-focused crossbowmen with raw bolt power**

## Weapon Types & Descriptions

### **Bows** – *Two-Handed, Manual Fire, Precision*

- Bows offer **greater rate of fire** and **higher accuracy** over distance, especially with high Dexterity.  
- They benefit from rapid positioning and keen tracking—perfect for open-field fights or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Stealth\|Stealth]] ambushes.
- Cannot be used with a shield or off-hand item.

| Bow Type       | STR/DEX Threshold | Fire Rate | Range     | Notes                                             |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Shortbow**   | 6 STR / 8 DEX     | High      | Medium    | Light and quick, great for mobile skirmishers     |
| **Longbow**    | 10 STR / 12 DEX   | Medium    | Long      | Higher draw weight, slower shots, great power     |
| **Recurve Bow**| 12 STR / 14 DEX   | High      | Long      | Enhanced power and range, premium for hunters     |

### **Crossbows** – *Mechanical, Easy Use, One-Handed or Two-Handed*

- Crossbows require **less technique** to use but **more Strength** to reload efficiently.  
- They deal **high burst damage** and can be **dual-wielded** (light varieties), though this increases reload times without specific talents.

| Crossbow Type     | STR/DEX Threshold | Handedness | Damage    | Reload Time | Notes                                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Light Crossbow**| 8 STR / 6 DEX     | One-Handed | Medium    | Fast        | Can be dual-wielded, solid backup weapon                  |
| **Repeater**      | 10 STR / 10 DEX   | One-Handed | Low       | Very Fast   | Lower base damage, but fires rapidly                      |
| **Heavy Crossbow**| 14 STR / 10 DEX   | Two-Handed | High      | Slow        | Excellent for siege defense or heavy ambushes             |

## Talents & Synergy

Characters who meet the minimum **combined attribute threshold** may access talents from the **Ranged Talent Line**, including:

- **Eagle’s Eye** – Increases zoom distance and accuracy.
- **Quick Nock** – Reduces draw/reload time for bows.
- **Piercing Bolt** – Bolts ignore a percentage of [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]].
- **Serrated Arrowheads** – Arrows inflict minor bleeding.

Ranged weapons may also benefit from Reflex-based talents for **dodging while firing**, or Mind-based talents that improve **focus and aim under pressure**.

## Use Cases

• **The Mobile Archer**  
  Wields a **shortbow** or **recurve**, uses [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Light Armor\|light armor]], and dances through combat zones while loosing arrows at targets of opportunity. High DEX, moderate STR, often doubles as a scout or hunter.

• **The Siege Marksman**  
  Specializes in **heavy crossbows**, high STR, and moderate DEX. Excels in high-damage shots, often planted in one position or using cover.

• **The Dual Crossbow Infiltrator**  
  Wields **two light crossbows**, leaning into burst damage at close range. Benefits from stealth talents and crowd control skills.

• **The Survivalist Ranger**  
  Carries a **longbow**, moderate gear, and survival tools. Maps terrain, crafts arrows, and picks off prey (or foes) with practiced precision.

## Interplay with Core Pillars

### **Combat**
- Ranged users must **choose engagements wisely**, controlling distance, managing reload times, and exploiting weak points.
- Certain enemies may be vulnerable only to ranged damage (e.g., airborne creatures, unreachable mages).
- Use cover, elevation, and terrain to maximize advantage.

### **Exploration**
- Archers can take down game animals to gather rations and pelts.
- Bows make excellent stealth tools for silent takedowns, allowing safer travel.
- Ranged characters can scout and **snipe from afar**, reducing the need for close-quarter engagements.

### **Survival**
- Carrying extra bolts or arrows increases [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]]- pack light or make frequent camp stops to restock.
- Custom arrowheads (crafted via **Alchemy or Survival Kits**) can provide effects like flame, poison, or knockback.
- Weather affects aim: wind can divert arrow trajectory, fog can reduce accuracy, and wet strings reduce firing speed.

## Summary

Bows and crossbows in *Chronicle* are versatile and deadly when wielded with strategic intent. Scaling with both **Strength** and **Dexterity**, they support a wide variety of builds from nimble rogues to heavily armored siege specialists. Whether firing from shadowed tree lines or unleashing volleys across the battlefield, ranged weapons offer precision and power to those who master them.

Build them. Hone them. **Let the world feel your aim.**
