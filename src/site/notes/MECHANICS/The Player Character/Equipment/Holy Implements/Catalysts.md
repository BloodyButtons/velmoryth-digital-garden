<center>SYMBOLS OF POWER</center>

---

**Catalysts** are the **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Invocation/Invocation\|Invocation]]-based** counterpart to arcane foci, designed for **Clerics, Paladins, Occultists,** and hybrid [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|faith]]-builds. Like foci, catalysts provide **Faith** (for invocation potency) or **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Mind\|Mind]]** (for memorizing additional holy/unholy spells), and can take various forms- **Holy Tomes**, **Censers**, **Prayer Beads**, or two-handed **Staves**. Higher-rarity catalysts occasionally grant both Faith and Mind bonuses, though these prized relics are famously rare. Each piece is an **optional but powerful** companion for those dedicating themselves to the **Invocation** pillar of *Chronicle*.

---

## Forms & Material Themes

Catalysts appear as **faith-centric** objects, usually associated with a deity, unholy power, or spiritual tradition:

1. **Holy/Unholy Tomes**  
   
   - Bound scriptures or forbidden grimoires containing liturgies, curses, or blessings.  
   
   - Provide textual guidance, focusing Faith-based spells through chanting or reading.  
 
   - Favored by scholarly clerics or occultists, bridging knowledge and invocation.

2. **Censers & Incense Burners**  
   
   - Hand-held vessels emitting sacred or cursed smoke.  
  
   - Amplify invocation range or status effects, especially if spells revolve around aura-based blessings or hexes.  
 
   - Perfect for multi-target blessings, purifications, or area-based curses.

3. **Prayer Beads**  
  
   - Strings of carved bone, polished stones, or metal icons.  
  
   - Used in rhythmic chanting or silent meditations to channel divine energies.  
  
   - Often minimal weight, easy to dual-wield with another small catalyst or weapon.

4. **Holy Staves** *(Two-Handed)*  
  
   - Tall staves topped with religious symbols or glyphs, reminiscent of staff-type weapons but specialized for Faith-based magic.  
  
   - Provide higher baseline Faith or Mind bonuses at the cost of occupying both hands, limiting weapon usage.

## Attribute & Rarity Bonuses

Just like arcane foci, catalysts yield attribute boosts primarily in:

- **Faith (FTH)** - Enhances damage, healing, or potency of Holy/Unholy Invocations.  
- **Mind (MIN)** - Expands the number of memorized invocation spells, crucial for multi-prayer tactics or advanced mental fortitude.

| Catalyst Type       | IL Range | Attribute Boost                  | Typical Use Cases                             |
|---------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Holy Tome           | 5–25    | +1–3 Faith or +1–2 Mind           | Small, can be dual-wielded; focuses chant-based spells  |
| Censer (One-Hand)   | 10–30   | +1–3 Faith, sometimes minor Mind  | Creates beneficial or corrupt auras, easy off-hand item |
| Prayer Beads        | 10–25   | +1–2 Faith or Mind                | Lightweight, synergy with meditation or repeated prayers |
| Holy/Unholy Staff   | 20–50   | +2–5 Faith or Mind, sometimes both| Two-handed, higher base bonus, advanced invocation mastery |

**Rare catalysts** might grant dual Faith + Mind bonuses- like **+3 Faith** and **+2 Mind**, but demand steep attribute thresholds (FTH 20+, MIN 15+) to avoid spiritual backlash.

## One-Handed vs. Two-Handed Catalysts

### One-Handed Catalysts

- **Dual Wield Potential**: A cleric or occultist might hold **Tome + Censer** or **Censer + Prayer Beads** for combined attribute boosts, mixing blessings with area smokes.  

- **Weapon Compatibility**: Hybrid builds can keep a single-handed catalyst in the off-hand while wielding a mace or sword. Perfect for paladins or zealots who fight physically but still channel potent faith spells.

### Two-Handed Catalyst (Holy Staff)

- **Higher Baseline Bonuses**: Grants bigger Faith or Mind buffs from the get-go, perfect for a full-caster approach reliant on large-scale invocations or healing.  

- **Hands Occupied**: Prevents using a shield or secondary weapon, making the user rely on spells for protection or sustain.

## Combat & Survival Interactions

1. **Invocation Potency**  
   
   - Catalysts amplify **Faith-based** healing, curses, hexes, or blessings. High Faith synergy means bigger AoE smites, stronger wards, or more durable [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Race/Undead\|undead]] thralls (for unholy paths).

2. **Spell Memorization**  
  
   - Mind-boosting catalysts enlarge your repertoire of simultaneous prayers or hexes, enabling combos of protective auras, healing bursts, and crowd-control curses.

3. **Hybrid Build Options**  
   
   - Characters with moderate Faith can keep a small catalyst (like a Censer) in the off-hand, using a weapon main-hand for consistent melee. The result: decent invocation support plus reliable [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Martial/Martial\|martial]] presence.

4. **Exploration & Resourcefulness**  
  
   - Some catalysts grant out-of-combat blessings—like short weather protection prayers or minor illusions to keep undead at bay.  
   
   - They can reduce reliance on potions or specialized gear if your invocations heal diseases or conjure buffs to manage harsh environments.

## Use Cases

1. **Battle Cleric (Hammer + Censer)**  
   
   - Offensive front-liner with moderate Faith. Strikes foes physically while harnessing aura-based buff or healing spells from the censer.  

   - Retains strong synergy with [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]] or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] for a robust front line, plus mid-level invocation powers.

2. **Devoted Healer (Two-Handed Holy Staff)**  
   
   - Maximizes Faith for potent group heals and protective blessings.  
 
   - Relies on allies to shield them in direct combat but can cast wide-area miracles or wards from behind.  
  
   - May invest some Mind to keep advanced healing spells and emergency curses simultaneously.

3. **Occult Hexblade (Tome + Dagger)**  
   
   - Faith oriented around unholy invocation or dark hexes.  
  
   - Off-hand: a **Tome of Curses** for hex synergy, main-hand: a swift dagger for close combat.  
   - Gains some Mind for memorizing multiple curses while having lethal short-range physical stabs.

4. **Faithful Ranger (Bow + Prayer Beads)**  
   
   - Low to moderate Faith for utility-based blessings (like minor healing or consecrated arrows).  
  
   - Leans on Dex for archery, relying on beads to cast quick prayers or short buffs mid-encounter.

## Summary

Catalysts embody **the conduit** of holy or unholy magic in *Chronicle*, bridging Faith-based invocations and Mind-based memorization capacity. Whether it’s a **Tome** brandished in tandem with a sword for hybrid battle or a **Holy Staff** hoisted by a devout full-caster, catalysts unify the **combat, survival, and exploration** pillars for those who walk the path of powerful faith. Their flexible design, **one-handed** for mixing with weapon/shield, or **two-handed** for amplified spiritual might, ensures every invocation user can tailor their gear to match personal goals and synergy in Velmoryth’s perilous environment.
