<center>LIFESAVING NON-MAGIC</center>

---

In *Chronicle*, not every affliction can or should be solved with a spell or divine boon. **Medical supplies** provide **practical, non-magical** methods for treating wounds, diseases, and other debilitating conditions. While they can’t replace full hospital care or advanced healing magic, these items can be the difference between life and death in remote dungeons or on the battlefield.

## Core Items & Uses

Below is an overview of essential medical supplies, highlighting their purpose, limitations, and usage details.

| Item          | Usage                                  | Effect                                        | Notes                                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Antidote**  | Ingested or injected when poisoned      | • Eliminates weaker poisons outright<br>• Lessens severity of stronger toxins | Typically carried in small vials or syringes; some advanced antidotes require exotic herbs. |
| **Poultice**  | Applied externally to infected wounds or consumed as a thick herbal blend | • Gradually purges diseases<br>• Slows progression of advanced ailments, while not curing them instantly | Powerful variants (Greater Poultices) act faster and hamper [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|disease]] at an earlier stage. |
| **Bandages**  | Wrapped around lacerations or open cuts | • Staunches bleeding (minor cuts or major hemorrhages if repeatedly changed)<br>• Reduces infection risk | Carried in rolls, must keep them sterile to avoid contamination.    |
| **Splints**   | Secured around fractured/broken bones   | • Stabilizes limb, reduces severity by ~25% in action<br>• Does not speed healing, only prevents further damage | Requires moderate [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] or assistance to apply effectively.       |
| **Burn Salve** (Example extra) | Applied to burn [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|injuries]] or scalded areas | • Soothes pain, speeds natural healing of burns by reducing infection<br>• Minimizes scarring if applied promptly | Often requires specialized ingredients from desert flora or alchemic distillation. |

## Detailed Explanations

### 1. Antidote

- **Form & Storage**: Typically stored in small glass vials, easy to carry in belt pouches.  

- **Effective Range**: 
 - *Weak poisons* (like basic swamp toxins) can be neutralized quickly.  

  - *Potent venoms* (from rare beasts or advanced alchemical traps) may only have their effects halved or slowed, requiring repeated doses or advanced antidote forms.

- **Synergy**: Characters with higher **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]]** might fight off [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Poison\|poison]] more efficiently, but applying an antidote in time drastically improves survival odds.

### 2. Poultice

- **Application**: Spread on the afflicted area or ingested (varies by recipe).  

- **Effects**: 
 
  - Slowly flushes disease from the body if used consistently.  

  - *Greater Poultices* shorten recovery times and hamper disease progression from the onset.  

- **Usage in Survival**: Key for extended expeditions in plague-ridden or cursed zones, bridging the gap if magical healing is unavailable.

### 3. Bandages

- **Usage**: 
 
  - Wrap wounds to reduce blood loss or cover open lacerations.  
 
  - In major bleeds, multiple bandages must be changed to maintain dryness and avoid infection.

- **Limitations**: 
 
  - If you sustain repeated hits while bandaged, you risk re-opening or infecting the wound.  

  - Does not heal damage, just prevents it from worsening.

### 4. Splints

- **Mechanics**: 
 
  - Reduces the functional penalty of a broken or fractured limb by about 25%.  
 
  - Must remain in place until the bone sets or advanced healing is done (naturally or via magical means).

- **Recovery**: 
 
  - Broken bones still require rest over in-game days. Splints keep the injury stable so players can continue traveling or fighting with penalty instead of complete disability.

### 5. Burn Salve 

- **Usage**: 
  
  - Spread gently over scorched skin to prevent infection and minimize scarring.  
 
  - May include cooling agents like aloe, arcane-laced solutions, or desert cacti extracts.

- **Effect**: 
  
  - Speeds up natural regeneration of burns, mitigating severe pain and infection risk.  
 
  - Pair with bandages for maximum effect in healing deep burns or acid wounds.

## Combat & Survival Context

1. **Immediate Battle Triage**  
  
   - In the midst of a fight, bandages or splints might keep a warrior on their feet. A quick-acting antidote can save a ranger from lethal swamp venom. They are vital, especially if no magical healing is on hand.

2. **Extended Journeys**  
   
   - Facing lengthy quests through disease-ridden catacombs or venomous swamps, carrying enough **poultices** and **antidotes** becomes indispensable.  
   
   - The synergy with **Attributes**: High Vitality shortens disease duration and reduces infection likelihood, but medical supplies further ensure safety.

3. **Resource Management & Strategy**  

   - Medical supplies aren’t infinite. Knowing how many bandages or antidotes to bring is critical—**overpacking** might weigh you down, while being understocked invites peril.

## Final Thoughts

**Medical Supplies** bridge the gap when **magical solutions** are scarce, expensive, or barred by skill constraints. They keep your party stable during **grueling treks**, emergent hazards, or fights against venomous beasts. While these remedies don’t equate to instant magical healing, they serve as **realistic, incremental aids** for injury management. Mastering their application can mean the difference between making camp safely at day’s end or succumbing to a festering wound miles from help.
