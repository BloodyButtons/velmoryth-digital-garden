## Cooking Kits

Cooking kits in *Chronicle* are **small but essential** sets of tools enabling players to **prepare food** out in the wild. Although not strictly mandatory- some adventurers survive on raw game or simple rations-cooking kits unlock the ability to **preserve meat**, craft more **nutritious meals**, and even brew certain alchemical recipes if combined with additional gear. For those who want to transform wilderness resources into reliable sustenance, these kits become indispensable.

## **What They Contain**

- **Pan or Simple Pot**  
  A versatile metal container that can handle most basic cooking tasks, from frying meat to boiling soup.

- **Utensil or Stirring Spoon**  
  Useful for preventing burns or scorching, ensuring evenly cooked meals.

- **Minor Seasoning / Salt Container**  
  A small canister to preserve meats or add flavor, crucial for making rations last longer.

*(Heavier or more elaborate kits might contain multiple pans, specialized ladles, or small racks for drying meat, but most players stick to minimal weight.)*

## **Synergy with Survival & Exploration**

- **Creating Rations**  
  Instead of relying on store-bought or foraged rations, you can **harvest fresh meat** from uncorrupted fauna and **cook** it into more nourishing meals. This effectively expands your travel radius, as you’re no longer pinned to a constant stream of purchased supplies.

- **Preserving Excess Food**  
  With enough salt or drying techniques (and a pan for lightly smoking or curing), you can craft rations that last longer. This helps when crossing barren landscapes or dungeons far from towns.

- **Camp Cooking Ritual**  
  Preparing cooked food offers **better [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]] recovery** than raw or processed alternatives, letting you push deeper into hostile areas before succumbing to [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|hunger]] or exhaustion. A restful camp with a hearty meal can be a morale boost for the entire party.

*(Note that cooking also requires a heat source like a campfire or a cooking stand, tying into your resource management. A kit alone won’t suffice without fuel or safe water.)*

## **[[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Mapping\|Mapping]] and Resource Discovery**

- **Marking Abundant Fauna**  
  Upon finding a region with healthy, uncorrupted wildlife, you might **tag it on your map**. Returning with a cooking kit ensures repeated harvests of fresh meat or unique local herbs for new recipes.

-  **Collaborative Parties**  
  If one party member invests in cooking [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]] or higher [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] for advanced recipes, cooking kits let them transform raw resources into specialty meals, granting small attribute buffs or minor status resistances.

## **Use Case Examples**

- **Solo Wanderer**  
  Carries a small skillet and a pouch of salt to cook modest meals from hunted rabbits or fish, minimizing reliance on towns for expensive rations.

- **Group Expedition**  
  A designated chef or ranger with more robust cooking kit sets up camp nightly, preparing hardy stews that restore [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]] more effectively than standard dried rations.

- **Alchemical Crossover**  
  Combining cooking skill with an **alchemical kit** can yield enhanced medicinal soups, mild remedies, or beneficial potions if the recipe calls for heat-based [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Preparation\|preparation]].

## **Summary**

Cooking kits highlight *Chronicle*’s commitment to **immersive resource management**, allowing adventurers to turn raw game or found herbs into viable provisions at their campsite. While not strictly necessary (one can survive on raw finds or store-bought rations), having a cooking kit broadens your **survival strategies**, conserves funds, and can yield more potent nourishment for extended treks or climatic battles. As you roam Velmoryth’s wild places, do consider packing that humble pan; you never know when a satisfying, home-cooked meal might tip the scales between success and starvation.
