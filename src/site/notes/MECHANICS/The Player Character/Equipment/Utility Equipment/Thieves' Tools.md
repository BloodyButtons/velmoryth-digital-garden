<center>A ROGUE'S BREAD AND BUTTER</center>

---

Thieves’ Tools are the **go-to** item for lockpicking and trap-disarming in *Chronicle*, enabling characters to bypass mechanical obstacles without resorting to brute force or complex magic. Unlike other gear that comes in varying quality tiers, Thieves’ Tools remain uniform—**no upgrades or downgrades**. Instead, the user’s **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Reflexes\|Reflexes]] (REF)** and any relevant infiltration [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]] determine success or failure against a trap or lock’s difficulty level.

---
  
## **Function & Requirements**

- **Reflex-Based**  
  Thieves’ Tools operate purely on **Reflexes**. If a lock or trap demands, for instance, 15 REF to disable, possessing Thieves’ Tools is mandatory but not sufficient alone—you must also meet or exceed that Reflex threshold.

- **Infinite Uses**  
  These tools don’t degrade with standard use. Each **Trap/Lock** check can be repeated as needed, though repeated attempts might risk time or attracting attention.

- **Mechanical Prowess**  
  The kit includes tension wrenches, fine picks, small files, and delicate pliers—precise instruments essential for manipulating intricate mechanisms quietly.

---
  
## **Applications & Checks**

- **Lockpicking**  
  Opening chests, gates, or sealed compartments often requires a certain Reflex value. Thieves’ Tools act as the **catalyst**—without them, the lock is unpickable unless you break it (which can cause noise or draw aggression).

- **Trap Disarming**  
  Pressure plates, tripwire crossbows, or runic triggers rely on mechanical points of tension that can be disabled with picks or pliers if your Reflexes match the trap’s difficulty. This saves potential [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|injuries]] or wasted resources from triggered alarms.

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Stealth\|Stealth]] & Infiltration**  
  Whether slipping through a castle’s side gate at night or venturing into hidden tombs, Thieves’ Tools grant a stealthy path forward. They’re integral in high-risk infiltration missions—where forcing a lock might spawn guards or monsters.

## **Visual Data**

| Item Name      | [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Durability\|Durability]] | Uses         | Requirement for Use | Typical REF Thresholds |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Thieves’ Tools | Unlimited  | Disarm traps,<br>Pick locks | Reflexes ~ 5–25 depending on difficulty | Basic Locks: ~5–10<br> Intermediate: ~15<br>Advanced: ~20+ |

- *No quality grades:* A single set suffices, so success hinges on the user’s Reflex stat.

- *Traps & Locks scale in difficulty:* Low-tier locks might only need ~5–10 REF, but advanced or magical-mech locks can demand 20+.

## **Use Cases**

- **Treasure Hunters**  
  Rely on Thieves’ Tools to quietly open chests brimming with relics. Stealthy or quick infiltration builds easily slip in and out without raising alarms.

- **Scout / Ranger**  
  While not purely roguish, these characters might keep a set handy for disabling basic wilderness traps or lair-based hazards. Reflex synergy keeps them safe from hidden pitfalls.

-  **Infiltration Mages**  
  Though primarily magical, a cunning illusionist may carry Thieves’ Tools to handle mechanical locks whenever illusions can’t directly override the object’s physical nature.

## **Summary**

Thieves’ Tools are the **mechanical gateway** to covert success in *Chronicle*, bridging simple puzzles and elaborate booby traps with the user’s keen Reflexes. Free from durability concerns or tiered upgrades, they revolve instead around skillful usage and sufficient attribute levels. If you aim to bypass locks or traps silently—rather than smashing them—you’ll want these slender picks and wrenches in your pack, letting you slip through obstacles that might otherwise stall progress or invite danger.
