<center>THE BACKBONE</center>

---

These essential tools support day-to-day survival, exploration, and crafting in *Chronicle*. While each item is relatively mundane on its own, together they form the backbone of any prepared adventurer’s kit.

---

## Overview 

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Compasses\|Compasses]]**  

  Crucial for [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Navigation\|navigation]] in a world without fast travel or modern cartography. Whether crossing dense forests or desert wastes, a steady compass bearing keeps you oriented and avoids wandering perilously off course.

---
  
- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Packs\|Packs]]**  

  Sturdy backpacks or satchels that expand your carrying capacity for weapons, rations, [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Medical Supplies/Medical Supplies\|medical supplies]], and loot. Ranging from simple leather knapsacks to reinforced expedition bags, a good pack helps distribute weight and prevents early [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]].

---
  
- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Lanterns & Torches\|Lanterns & Torches]]**  
  Provide reliable light sources for venturing into dark dungeons, nocturnal hunting, or fog-shrouded ruins. Torches burn brightly but briefly, while lanterns offer a steadier glow—ideal for extended underground forays or camping under moonless skies.

---
  
- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Thieves' Tools\|Thieves' Tools]]**  
  A must-have for lockpicking, trap disarming, or silent entry into restricted areas. Includes small picks, tension wrenches, and other specialized implements that reduce reliance on brute force or costly magical solutions.

---
  
- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Waterskins\|Waterskins]]**  
  Hold a precious supply of clean water for staying hydrated over lengthy travel. Vital in arid biomes or scorching deserts, waterskins also let you boil questionable sources on the go to avoid [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|disease]].

---
  
- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Cooking Kits\|Cooking Kits]]**  
  Contain a cooking pot, utensils, and basic implements for preparing food in the field. Great for converting raw game into nutritious meals, preserving rations, or brewing simple stews and teas to stave off [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|hunger]] and fatigue.

---
  
- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Charcoal & Parchment\|Charcoal & Parchment]]**  
  Allow you to map unknown territory, record found lore, or track resource usage. Essential for custom cartography when landmarks are your only guide, or for jotting crucial clues gleaned from old tomes.

---
  
- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Alchemical Kits\|Alchemical Kits]]**  
  Small sets of vials, mortar and pestle, and burners letting you refine herbs and raw materials into potions, antidotes, or salves without needing arcane [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]]. Great for practical self-reliance in hostile regions.

---
  
- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Bedrolls & Tents\|Bedrolls & Tents]]**  
  Simple yet indispensable gear for safe rest. Bedrolls offer comfort and mild warmth, while tents provide shelter from rain, cold, or sandstorms. Ensures you can recover [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]] and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|health]] overnight, even in treacherous terrain.

---

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Whetstones\|Whetstones]]**
  Whetstones are a vital piece of kit for any blade using character. They preserve [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Durability\|Durability]] on weapons and the more care you put into your gear, the better it will serve you.
## Summary

While not all are wholly necessary, Utility Items and equipment provide a much needed boon to the survivors of Velmoryth's wilds. Whether it be Compasses, Bedrolls, or Cooling Kits, all players will need **something** to sustain the journey.
