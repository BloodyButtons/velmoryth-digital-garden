<center>RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE WILDS</center>

---

Alchemical Kits in *Chronicle* are **portable sets** of vials, mortar and pestle, small burners, and other fundamental instruments that let adventurers practice **potioncraft** away from major towns or formal apothecaries. By gathering herbs, minerals, or exotic monster parts and combining them under the right conditions (usually at a **campfire**), a resourceful character can brew potions to address **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|temperature]], restoring [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|Health]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Mana\|Mana]], and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]], or curing** needs mid-journey.

## **Kit Contents**

- **Mortar & Pestle**  
  For grinding herbs, minerals, and reagents into workable powders or pastes.

- **Vials & Bottles**  
  Store final concoctions safely. Some advanced kits include **sealed glass** or **resistant flasks** for volatile brews.

- **Small Burner**  
  Allows simmering or distillation over a controlled flame, typically placed atop a campfire or using a small brazier.

- **Measuring Implements**  
  Spoons, droppers, or tiny scales for precise reagent ratios, crucial to avoid wasted materials or botched results.

## **Usage & Requirements**

- **Campfire Dependency**: 
  Crafting potions generally requires a stable **heat source**. Campfires are most common, but skilled alchemists might adapt to lava vents, large torches, or improvised setups.

- **Attribute Influence**:
  While raw [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] aren’t typically central, moderate **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]]** (INT) aids in mastering advanced recipes, ensuring minimal reagent loss. Characters with **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Mind\|Mind]]** (MIN) might manage complex brews or illusions-based potions more effectively.

- **Inventory Management**:
  Alchemical kits take up **modest space**, but multiple vials or ingredients can weigh down a traveling party. Deciding which recipes or reagents to bring is an essential strategy.

## **Example Potions**

- **Emberbrew**  
  Provides mild **fire resistance** and warmth, excellent in frozen mountains or when battling flame-wielding foes.

- **Frostshield Draught**  
  Lowers body temperature in scorching deserts, mitigating dehydration and heat exhaustion.

- **Soothing Tonic**  
  Aids wound recovery over time, offering mild healing without relying on direct magical spells. Often used in tandem with bandages for gradual recovery.

- **Silverthorn Serum**  
  Temporarily boosts [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|disease]] resistance—particularly effective against swamp fevers or necrotic plagues. The effect is short-lived but lifesaving if you lack a skilled healer.

- **Purification Elixir**  
  Neutralizes weaker poisons and toxins. More potent versions rival dedicated antidotes, but require rare reagents found in venomous creature lairs.

## **Relation to Core Systems**

- **Survival**  
  Alchemical potions can **reduce reliance** on rations or magical healing in dangerous or remote zones. Heating potions stave off freezing nights, while healing potions alleviate [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|injuries]] in mid-fight.

- **Crafting & Resource Management**  
  Gathering unique plants or monster drops fosters exploration. A prepared alchemist invests time in discovering new reagents, forging synergy with hunting or foraging party roles.

- **Combat & Strategy**  
  Quick consumption of potions can tilt battles—like suddenly resisting fire spells or regaining enough strength to endure a final boss onslaught. Smartly timed potion use can mean the difference between victory and party wipe.

- **Exploration**  
  Certain advanced potions might offer limited flight, underwater breathing, or illusions to bypass environmental hazards—potentially opening new routes or shortcuts.

## **Summary**

Alchemical kits enable **potioncraft on the go**, bridging survival, combat, and exploration pillars in *Chronicle*. By combining harvested reagents under campfire conditions, players craft potions that protect against extreme elements, mend wounds, or counteract threats like [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Poison\|poison]] and disease. While **potioncraft** has its own depth, the kit remains a vital piece of any resourceful adventurer’s loadout, reflecting *Chronicle*’s spirit of hands-on problem-solving and immersive journeying.
