<center>ESSENTIAL KIT</center>

---

Waterskins serve as **essential containers** for storing and transporting water- clean or otherwise within *Chronicle*. Though they seem simple, they can prove **vital** for long expeditions or survival in remote wilderness, especially in arid climates where the scarcity of fresh water can quickly overwhelm even the hardiest adventurer. 

---

## **Basic Concept**

- **Carrying Clean Water**  
   On extended treks, having enough potable water prevents dehydration and slows [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]] buildup. In desert zones or high-altitude passes, water consumption spikes, making a reliable waterskin indispensable.

- **Dirty Water Transport**  
  In emergencies, players can **fill** their waterskins with unpurified water, then boil or filter it back at camp to avoid [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|disease]].  
  This method is crucial if you’re far from permanent safe water sources.

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|Encumbrance]] Trade-off**  
  Larger waterskins hold more but weigh you down. Adventurers must balance capacity with **inventory load**—especially if wearing medium or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Heavy Armor\|heavy armor]].  
  Higher **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]** or **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]]** partially offsets the burden of hauling water.

## **Varieties & Encumbrance**

| Waterskin Type       | Capacity (Approx.) | Encumbrance Weight | Notes                                       |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Small Skin           | ~1 day’s supply    | Very Low           | Basic, discreet, often carried by scouts.   |
| Standard Waterskin   | ~2–3 days’ supply  | Low                | Common for most adventurers on short trips. |
| Large Waterskin      | ~5 days’ supply    | Moderate           | Suited for extended solo expeditions or small parties. |
| Expedition Reservoir | ~7–8 days’ supply  | High               | Heavy, often requiring a sturdy pack or beast of burden. |

*(“Days’ supply” presumes typical consumption for one person in mild climates, harsh deserts or strenuous activities increase usage.)*

## **Survival & Exploration Interplay**

- **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|Hunger]] & [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|Thirst]] Management**  
  With waterskins, you’re less reliant on stumbling upon rivers or wells mid-journey. This not only saves time, but also reduces risk if local water is contaminated.

- **Resource Planning**  
  Party members coordinate who carries which water capacity—some might rely on spells or religious invocations for purification, while others keep large stock for the group.

- **Encumbrance Synergy**  
  If you already bear heavy gear (armor, weapons), carting an **Expedition Reservoir** could hamper movement significantly. Balancing your load becomes a key strategic choice—particularly vital in survival-driven gameplay.

## **Summary**

Waterskins act as a **lifeline** for travelers in *Chronicle* ensuring they can explore distant biomes without constantly seeking fresh water. Whether you opt for a small skin for light, agile travel or a massive reservoir for group endurance, carrying this essential container is a cornerstone of **survival** and **exploration** across Velmoryth’s dangerous expanses.
