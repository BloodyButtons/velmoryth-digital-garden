<center>TO GONE YOUR BLADES</center>

---

Whetstones in *Chronicle* serve as **maintenance items** for bladed or pointed weapons, preserving and slightly enhancing their effectiveness between formal smithing sessions. While they can’t outright transform a mediocre blade into a legendary one, whetstones do **prolong weapon [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Durability\|durability]]** and add a modest damage bump, enough to tip some skirmishes in your favor. However, the raw increase in damage is minor and never eclipses the value of upgrading to truly superior gear.

When used periodically (often at camp or mid-journey downtime), a whetstone can **restore** some of a weapon’s lost durability, preventing it from breaking prematurely. Each whetstone tier influences how much durability a weapon recovers and how noticeable the small damage bonus becomes. In exchange, higher-grade whetstones weigh more, contributing to overall **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]]**.

### Whetstone Grades

| Whetstone Grade       | Weight (Encumbrance) | Durability Bonus           | Damage Bonus        | Notes                                                     |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Whetstone**   | Very Low            | +5–10% weapon durability   | +1 raw damage       | Common, light. Suitable for short journeys.              |
| **Refined Whetstone** | Low                 | +10–15% weapon durability  | +2 raw damage       | A bit heavier, more effective for recurring upkeep.       |
| **Honed Whetstone**   | Moderate            | +15–20% weapon durability  | +3 raw damage       | Favored by dedicated melee fighters who preserve gear for tough dungeons. |
| **Master-Grade Stone**| Moderate–High       | +25% weapon durability     | +4 raw damage       | Heavier, more expensive. Best for long expeditions or extended hunts. |

*(Percent bonuses reference how much of the weapon’s maximum durability is restored or effectively “buffered.” The raw damage additions are minor but can stack up if your weapon is well above average or in prime condition.)*

### Usage & Application

- **Encumbrance Trade-off**  
  Heavier stones yield better results, but weigh down an adventurer’s pack. High **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]** and **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]]** help offset the load.

- **Maintenance Routine**  
  Typically used during **camp setup** or short breaks, where you can thoroughly sharpen edges. A rushed, in-[[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Combat\|combat]] usage is possible but less efficient.

- **Pairing with Weapon Tiers**  
  Even with a high-grade whetstone, an inferior weapon can’t rival the raw damage or attributes of truly superior gear. Still, the stone extends its lifespan and keeps it in peak condition.

### The Necessity Of Whetstones

- **Prolonging Expeditions**  
  In deep dungeons or hostile wilds far from a smith, letting weapons dull or break can prove disastrous. Whetstones ensure you press on without forced retreats for repairs.

- **Saving Costs**  
  Regular maintenance with a whetstone delays the need for full smithing repairs, cutting gold expenditure over many fights.

- **Slight Combat Edge**  
  That minor damage bump sometimes secures a kill or shortens a fight, valuable in battles of attrition where every point of damage counts.

## **Summary**  

Whetstones provide **low-key yet critical** upkeep for melee adventurers in *Chronicle*, balancing extra weight for improved durability and a small edge in damage. While no substitute for finding or forging superior arms, they often stand between a battered sword’s survival and total breakage—an inexpensive safeguard against being caught unarmed miles from civilization.
