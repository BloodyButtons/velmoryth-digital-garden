<center>A PLACE TO LAY YOUR HEAD</center>

---

Bedrolls and tents form the cornerstone of **safe rest** in *Chronicle*, allowing characters to **recover [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]]** (and thereby reduce [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]]) when making camp. Where some adventurers might huddle in a damp cave, those with proper sleeping gear not only manage their recovery more effectively but also fend off harsh weather conditions.

## **Placing Bedrolls & Tents**  

Placing a bedroll or tent is a **manual action** at camp. It doesn’t magically heal [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|injuries]], but it **restores fatigue** so your maximum stamina can return to normal. The process usually requires some downtime- enough to sleep, reflect, or gather mental resources.

---
  
## **Tents**

Tents offer **added weather protection**, preventing exposure-based stamina penalties. They let you skip searching for caves or stable overhangs in inclement weather—key for staying warm and safe through storms.

---

## **Recovery Dynamics**

- **Fatigue vs. Stamina**  
  When you’re fatigued, your maximum stamina is capped below its potential. Low-quality bedrolls restore your **fatigue** (raising the cap), but you’ll still need time or moderate activity to let actual stamina catch up to the new maximum.

- **Quality & Sleep Rates**  
  Higher-quality sleeping gear speeds **active stamina restoration** once your fatigue limit is reset. Consequently, you can rejoin arduous fights or long travel with fewer rest cycles.

## **Comparative Table**

| Gear               | Quality | Fatigue Recovery | Immediate Stamina Recovery?   | Weather Protection   | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Basic Bedroll      | Low     | Moderate         | No — stamina must rise slowly | None                 | Simple blanket/mat combo, cheap but minimal comfort          |
| Reinforced Bedroll | Medium  | Good             | Minor partial stamina restore | None                 | Thicker cushioning, reduces muscle aches, slightly heavier   |
| Deluxe Bedroll     | High    | Very Good        | Yes — some immediate stamina  | None                 | Often stuffed with plush or arcane-treated fill; more costly |
| Simple Tent        | Low     | Moderate         | No                            | Yes (basic)          | Protects against mild rain, wind; minimal warmth inside      |
| Reinforced Tent    | Medium  | Good             | Minor partial stamina restore | Yes (strong weather) | Solid construction, stands up to storms; pairs with bedroll  |
| Expedition Tent    | High    | Very Good        | Yes                           | Yes (cold, storms)   | Often includes insulation layers or weather wards, pricy     |

## **Use Cases**

- **Solo Adventurer**  
  Carries a lightweight **Basic Bedroll** or **Simple Tent** to maintain essential rest. Perfect for Dex-based rogues who must keep inventory minimal.

  
- **Party-Based Expedition**  
  Might share a **Reinforced Tent** for multiple people, ensuring everyone avoids stamina penalties in foul weather. Pair with **medium or deluxe bedrolls** for speedier recovery in lengthy campaigns.

  
- **Harsh Climate Survival**  
  Characters traversing subzero mountain passes or scorching deserts likely rely on **Deluxe Bedrolls** plus **Expedition Tents** to offset heavy climate fatigue.

---

## **Tactical & Survival Interplay**

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|Encumbrance]] Trade-offs**  
  Higher-quality bedrolls or tents are bulkier, demanding a balance of comfort, stamina restoration, and available pack space.

- **Camp Placement**  
  Setting camp in safer, more hidden locations remains wise—even the best tent won’t shield you from wild beast ambushes if placed too openly. [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Stealth\|Stealth]] or vantage-based decisions reduce midnight attacks.

- **Resource Management**  
  Potions, spells, or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]] that offset fatigue can synergize with simpler bedrolls, but large parties or those traveling through dangerous climates benefit immensely from better gear.

## **Summary**

Bedrolls and tents shape the **rest and recovery** dimension of *Chronicle*. With higher-quality items yielding faster stamina bounce-backs and potent weather shielding, they become vital for extended journeys off the beaten path. Adventurers are free to skimp on sleeping gear- exchanging lower cost and weight for slower recovery, but thorough planning with **deluxe bedrolls** or **expedition tents** can be a literal lifesaver when survival depends on bouncing back to full strength by dawn.
