<center>TO MAP THE WORLD</center>

---

Charcoal and parchment form the **foundation** of any **[[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Mapping\|mapping]]** and **note-taking** endeavors in *Chronicle.* Because players must rely on **landmark [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Navigation\|navigation]]** (as opposed to a minimap or automated cues), having a **physical way** to record your findings is crucial. Whenever you explore new terrain, unearth hidden passages, or stumble upon valuable resources, **charcoal and parchment** let you **draft** those discoveries into a workable map or personal journal.

## **Core Functions**

- **Mapping & Landmark Reference**  
  Making rough sketches of mountain ranges, forest clearings, or ruins is possible thanks to these tools. This not only prevents backtracking or confusion later but also helps chart safe routes or warn of known dangers.

- **Annotation of Points of Interest**  
  When encountering rare herbs, hidden altars, or cryptic puzzle rooms, you can note their exact location or relevant puzzle hints. This is particularly beneficial if you decide to revisit for resources or quest-related objectives.

- **Collaborative Knowledge**  
  In party-based adventures, your drawn notes or partial map can be shared amongst allies, ensuring everyone is familiar with discovered paths, shortcuts, or ambient threats. Especially handy if the team splits up or if a new member joins partway.

## **Interplay with Survival**

-  **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|Hunger]] & [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|Thirst]] Conservation**  
   By drawing an accurate map, you’re **less likely** to get lost and waste precious rations and water searching for landmarks or safe havens.

- **Resource Planning**  
  When you document deposit sites, rivers, or pockets of safe camping spots, you minimize the need for improvised travel decisions that might lead into hazardous territory unprepared.

- **Fatigue Avoidance**  
  Time spent meandering or retracing steps increases **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]]**—a navigational error can mean an unexpected night in a region unfit for camp. Accurate notes mitigate these unnecessary detours.

## **Implications for Exploration**

- **Self-Guided Progress**  
  Instead of relying on a game-provided minimap, you physically track your advancement in the world. This fosters a sense of genuine discovery as your parchment slowly fills with details.

- **Questing & Story Hooks**  
  Lore fragments, cryptic runes, or NPC hints can be recorded alongside your map notes. Maintaining thorough documentation prevents forgetting crucial leads when you’re tens of miles away from the original site.

- **Iterative Cartography**  
  The more you explore, the more detailed your notes become. You may refine broad-stroke outlines into sharper overlays, labeling vantage points, hidden passages, or even coding personal remarks for treasure stashes.

## **Summary**

Charcoal and parchment are **vital** to every adventurer’s bag. By mixing **creative cartography** with real-time annotation, you link the **exploration** and **survival** pillars—ensuring you never traverse blindly, can strategize resource usage, and maintain a cumulative record of your journeys. In a realm where memory alone isn’t enough to recall labyrinthine forests or remote desert outcrops, **charcoal and parchment** prove indispensable for forging a personal map of Velmoryth’s boundless frontiers.
