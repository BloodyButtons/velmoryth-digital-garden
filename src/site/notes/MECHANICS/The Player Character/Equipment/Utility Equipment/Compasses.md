<center>A TOOL FOR MAKING YOUR WAY</center>

---

Compasses are the cornerstone of **[[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Navigation\|navigation]]** and **exploration** in *Chronicle*. Since players must rely on **landmarks** and **physical maps** rather than automated wayfinding, a well-kept compass ensures you never lose your sense of direction. By pointing to a consistent bearing (usually north), compasses let you chart courses, find hidden paths, and stick to planned routes without wandering astray in trackless wastes.

  
Mundane Compasses are **small metal instruments**, often circular, housing a magnetized needle that always aligns north under normal conditions. They fit easily into a traveler’s pouch or kit, weighing very little but providing immense peace of mind when you’re braving dense forests, foggy lowlands, or labyrinthine valleys.

  
An [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Conjuring/Ethereal Compass\|Ethereal Compass]] is conjured by skilled casters, serve much the same purpose but exist as a **minor magical effect**, drawing on a trickle of [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Mana\|mana]] to manifest a ghostly floating needle or ephemeral arrow. This ethereal pointer likewise orients to magnetic north or a chosen arcane signature (like an [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Conjuring/Arcane Mark\|Arcane Mark]]), but at the cost of occupying a **spell slot**. For adventurers strapped for pack space or focusing on minimal [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]], the ethereal compass can free them from carrying a physical item, though prolonged usage can accumulate a steady drain on mana reserves or mental focus.

  
Whether you trust the time-tested reliability of a **mundane compass** or a quick incantation for an **ethereal compass**, having a stable sense of direction remains critical in a world where **landmark navigation** dominates. Should you lose your bearings in the middle of harsh weather or deep underground, these compasses spare you from wandering blindly, letting you keep vital supply usage to a minimum and ensuring every step leads closer to safety—or to your sought-after destination.
