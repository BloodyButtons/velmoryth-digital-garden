<center>A NECESSARY WEIGHT TO BEAR</center>

---

Packs (backpacks, rucksacks, or similar) in *Chronicle* serve one simple yet crucial role: **inventory expansion**. They occupy the same slot as a **quiver**, forcing archers and crossbow users to forgo specialized quiver bonuses if they choose to carry a pack instead. Still, a pack can hold a small stash of arrows (albeit not with any quiver-specific enchantments) and proves invaluable for anyone short on rations, potions, or miscellaneous gear.
 
They do **not** impart [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|temperature]] benefits or advanced magical perks—only extra carrying space at the expense of **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]]**. Even so, packs are almost always worth having. Characters planning lengthy journeys or braving dungeons full of loot rely on a robust backpack to store essential items like [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Alchemical Kits\|alchemical kits]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Bedrolls & Tents\|Bedrolls & Tents]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Lanterns & Torches\|Lanterns & Torches]], and extra food.

## **Encumbrance & Tradeoffs**

- A pack weighs you down, potentially slowing movement or increasing [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]] usage over long treks.  

- High **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]** or moderate **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]]** can offset the worst of these penalties, ensuring you can comfortably handle more gear.  

 - While archers can still stash arrows inside a pack, they lose out on specialized quiver enchantments (e.g., elemental arrow boosts), so they must decide whether the additional inventory is worth relinquishing those possible arrow benefits.

## **Quality & Capacity**

Below is a comparison table showing different pack tiers, each providing various carrying capacities and encumbrance levels. Higher-grade packs often feature better craftsmanship or minor enchantments to reduce load strain.

| Pack Type            | Carry Capacity  | Encumbrance      | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Sack**       | Low            | Very Low         | Minimal expansions – maybe a few days' rations or small loot items.   |
| **Knapsack**         | Moderate       | Low–Moderate     | Common among average adventurers; holds cooking kit, bedroll, or potions. |
| **Reinforced Pack**  | High           | Moderate         | Durable materials for heavier loads without tearing. Good for group expeditions. |
| **Expedition Rucksack** | Very High   | High             | Favored by longtime explorers crossing harsh landscapes; numerous pouches.  |
| **Arcane Storage Pack** *(rare)* | High or Very High   | Medium–High + partial offset | Slight enchantment reduces effective weight carried. Costly and sought-after.   |

## **Use Cases**

- **Solo Survivalists**  
  Who prefer to tote extra rations or foraging results, relying less on towns for daily supplies. Basic sacks or knapsacks meet most short- to mid-range needs.

  
- **Party-Based Explorers**  
  Carry [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Cooking Kits\|cooking kits]], bedrolls, healing potions, or [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Mapping\|mapping]] supplies in a **Reinforced Pack** or **Expedition Rucksack**. Ideal for extended campaigns well beyond major [[MECHANICS/Overworld/Settlements\|settlements]].

  
- **Archers & Hybrids**  
  May opt for a pack instead of a quiver if they desire more versatile inventory—carrying potions, [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Medical Supplies/Medical Supplies\|medical supplies]], or field gear. They sacrifice specialized arrow capacity or quiver enchantments in exchange.

## **Summary**

Packs epitomize **practical resource management** in *Chronicle*, letting players juggle extra gear or more extensive survival kits at the cost of heavier load. While archers might lament losing a specialized quiver’s perks, the broad utility of carrying extra food, potions, or crafting tools often outweighs that tradeoff. By choosing a pack suited to their Strength and adventure scope—from simple knapsacks to robust expedition rucksacks—characters secure the freedom to stay out longer, gather rarer materials, and brave more perilous territory without constant resupply stops.
