<center>A GUIDING LIGHT</center>

---
## Lanterns & Torches

Lanterns and torches provide **illumination** for adventurers exploring the darker corners of Velmoryth, whether delving into sunken catacombs, trekking through moonless nights, or camping in dense forests. Aside from revealing hidden paths and dangers, **firelight** can terrify some beasts or minor [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Race/Undead\|undead]], offering a modest deterrent effect. Even so, these items require ongoing maintenance—torches eventually burn out, while lanterns need **oil**. Mages may opt for conjured **Mage Light**, but it lacks both warmth and the [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Strength Talents/Intimidation\|intimidation]] factor of open flames.

## Torches

- **Function**  
  Carried in one hand, torches burn for a **limited duration** before turning to ash. They illuminate a moderate radius around the user, driving away darkness in real time.

  
- **Warmth & Fear Factor**  
  Torches offer a tiny source of **warmth** in cold climates and can **frighten minor creatures** averse to open flames. This can save travelers from nocturnal pests or lesser undead.

  
- **Maintenance**  
  Crafted cheaply from rags, resin, and wood. Once a torch is spent, you’ll need to **light another** from a campfire, lantern, or flint and steel.

  
- **Hand Occupancy**  
  Since a torch requires a **dedicated hand**, [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Combat\|combat]] or utility actions may be more cumbersome unless you drop or sheath the torch.

## Lanterns

- **Function**  
  Lanterns offer **steady, contained light**. They can be **affixed to a belt**, staff, or carried by a handle, freeing your hands for combat or other gear.

  
- **Lantern Oil**  
  Unlike a torch’s one-time burn, lanterns require **oil** refills. Oil can be found or purchased from towns, typically sold in small flasks or larger canisters.

  
- **Encumbrance**  
  Heavier and bulkier than a torch, a lantern adds to **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]]**. It’s sturdier than a torch flame (less prone to extinguishing in high winds) but demands resource management—more cost, more weight, and regular oil.

  
-  **Use Cases**  
  Ideal for extended dungeon crawls where you need stable, hands-free lighting, or if you want to maintain your [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|posture]] in combat without dropping your light source.

## Mage Light

- **Description**  
  A [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Conjuring/Conjuration\|Conjuration]] minor spell letting mages **conjure a glowing orb** or luminous wisp. It drifts nearby, illuminating an area without requiring a physical flame.

  
- **Comparisons**  
  Mage Light doesn’t produce **warmth** nor does it scare away enemies fearful of fire. It also costs **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Mana\|mana]]** (and a potential spell slot), so repeated castings may drain resources.

  
- **Mobility & Convenience**  
  Provides flexible, positionable light for quick or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Stealth\|Stealth]]-based objectives. Perfect for arcane infiltration but lacks the deterrent factor of true fire.

|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Torch**          | 1 (carried)     | Self-contained | Minor warmth  | Minor scare vs. some creatures   | Very low  | Burns out after limited time        |
| **Lantern**        | 0–1 (belt/hand)| Lantern Oil    | Negligible    | Minor scare vs. some creatures   | Moderate  | Longer duration, stable flame       |
| **Mage Light**     | None (spell slot) | Mana (periodic) | None       | None        | None       | Doesn’t hamper a hand, no warmth or fear effect |

## Summary

Torches, lanterns, and Mage Light ensure explorers confront the terrors of darkness on their own terms. Though each offers illumination, they vary in **resource usage**, **defense potential**, and **encumbrance**. Torches are cheap, can spook minor foes, and provide small warmth—but take up a hand. Lanterns free your hands if affixed properly, but need oil and weigh more. Mage Light grants full mobility and no fuel cost but forgoes warmth and fear advantage. Matching your **survival strategy**, **encumbrance tolerance**, and **attribute synergy** to the right light source is key to thriving in Velmoryth’s perilous nights.
