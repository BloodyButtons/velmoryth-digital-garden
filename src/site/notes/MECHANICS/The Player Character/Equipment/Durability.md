<center>LOSS OVER TIME</center>

---

Weapon durability in *Chronicle* functions as a fundamental layer of the **survival** and **[[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Combat\|combat]] experience**, grounding the player in the physical reality of their gear. Weapons, like the characters who wield them, wear down over time—dulled by repeated use, damaged by harsh elements, or cracked under the weight of brutal combat. Every swing, block, or clash with [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]] takes a toll.

Durability is tracked per weapon and steadily decreases during use. Once a weapon's durability reaches zero, it does not break permanently, but becomes **"compromised"**—significantly reducing its effectiveness. In this state, it deals **reduced damage**, has **increased [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]] cost**, and may even have a chance to **glance off armor**, failing to apply status effects or [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|posture]] damage.

## Ways to Maintain Durability

### **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Utility Equipment/Whetstones\|Whetstones]]**

- **Consumable items** that temporarily sharpen a weapon, increasing both its **damage** and **durability buffer**.
- Come in various grades, each imparting slightly higher bonuses and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]].
- Can be applied **at any time** outside of active combat, but only last for a limited number of strikes before needing reapplication.
- Provide an additional layer of resource planning—do you sharpen now before a potential fight or save it for a known encounter?

### **Smith Repairs**

- **Smiths** in major [[MECHANICS/Overworld/Settlements\|settlements]] or outposts can **fully restore** a weapon's durability for a price, based on the item’s **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Item Level\|Item Level]]** and **rarity**.
- Some **field forges** or rare tools may allow partial repairs while exploring.
- Repairing is not instantaneous—**some time must be spent** at a forge or with a smith, reinforcing the resting and planning aspect of survival gameplay.

---

## Strategic Considerations

- **Backup weapons** are often essential, especially for long treks or dungeon delves.
- Whetstones are useful for **maintaining primary weapons** when a smith is too far off—but they are **limited and encumbering**.
- Durability loss encourages **intentional combat**—every strike matters.
- Some enemies (particularly Beasts or creatures with acidic blood) may **degrade weapon durability faster**, making knowledge and [[MECHANICS/Exploration/Components/Preparation\|preparation]] vital.
- Certain **unique weapons** may have passive traits that **slow durability degradation**, while others may be more fragile in exchange for higher power.

## Integration with Core Pillars

### **Combat**
- Encourages weapon mastery and discipline—players who wildly swing without thought will see their tools fail them.
- Elevates the tension of long battles and dungeon expeditions, especially without access to repair tools.
- Balances powerful weapons with the reality that **high-damage output may wear them down faster**.

### **Survival**
- Reinforces the need to pack appropriately. Carrying extra gear, a whetstone, or identifying where smiths are becomes part of long-term planning.
- Forges and blacksmiths act as **critical survival hubs** in towns, giving narrative weight to places that might otherwise be ignored.

### **Exploration**
- Ties into the need to **return to town**, **find a forge**, or **scout for materials** if your weapon is nearly broken deep in hostile territory.
- Some ruins or dungeons may hide **ancient anvils or forges**, allowing restoration or crafting in the field—for those clever enough to find them.

## Summary

Weapon durability isn’t just a stat in *Chronicle*—it’s a storytelling device, a gameplay limiter, and a survival mechanic all rolled into one. The best blade is only as good as the care its bearer gives it. So sharpen well, plan ahead, and strike true—because even the finest steel wears thin in the world of Velmoryth.
