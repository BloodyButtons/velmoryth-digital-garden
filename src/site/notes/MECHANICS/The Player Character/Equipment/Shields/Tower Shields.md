<center>IMMOVABLE BASTIONS </center>

---

Tower shields are the **largest and heaviest** form of personal shield in *Chronicle*, designed to create a **mobile wall** between the bearer and incoming threats. Constructed of thick steel or other dense materials, these towering slabs require **significant [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]** to wield effectively and **high [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]]** to endure the [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]] drain. In return, the user gains unparalleled frontal coverage, drastically reducing damage and [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|posture]] loss from nearly any direct assault.

They typically stand from a wielder’s shoulders down to their shins (or even ankles), whether rectangular or curved. Some feature metal spikes, viewing slots, or carved designs that reflect a knightly order or personal crest.

## Attributes & Mechanics

- **High Strength Requirement**  

  Tower shields demand higher STR than any other shield category. Lower-STR characters risk excessive stamina drain, sluggish movement, and frequent posture breaks.

- **Vitality Synergy**  

  Posture stability under repeated hits relies partly on the user’s VIT—helping sustain stamina, offset heavy [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]], and reduce knockback or guard breaks.

- **Stamina & Posture**  

  When [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Blocking\|blocking]] with a tower shield, you incur the **highest stamina usage** of all shield types, but likewise benefit from **minimal posture damage** if you meet or exceed recommended thresholds. This creates a fortress-like defense—so long as your stamina holds.

## Comparisons to Other Shields

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Light Shields\|Light Shields]]**  
 
  Smaller coverage, minimal weight  
  Low stamina drain, strong parry potential  
  Cannot reliably negate large hits compared to tower shields

-  **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Heavy Shields\|Heavy Shields]]**  
   Balanced defense and coverage. Moderately high Strength requirement. Tower shields surpass heavy [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Shields\|shields]] in coverage at a higher stamina cost.

-  **Tower Shields**  
   Maximum frontal protection. Highest Strength and stamina overhead. Functions like a near wall, letting you lock down choke points or spearhead advances.

## Use Cases & Examples

-  **Immovable Tank**  
   A Strength + Vitality build wearing heavy plate, using a tower shield to lock down entire corridors. Ideal for group play where you soak hits while allies deal damage.

-  **Siege Line Tactics**  
   In certain large-scale fights or boss encounters, multiple tower shield users can form a “wall,” virtually stopping projectiles or physical rushes until stamina depletes or flanks are exposed.

- **Slow Advancing Guardian**  
  Characters who prefer a methodical approach—marching forward under heavy fire, relying on [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|Faith]]-based healing or arcane buffs to sustain stamina. Movement is slow but nigh unstoppable.

## Summary

Tower shields excel when you commit to unwavering defense. As long as you have the stamina and attributes to manage the massive weight, you gain an unmatched frontal barrier—shielding yourself and nearby allies from even the fiercest onslaught.
