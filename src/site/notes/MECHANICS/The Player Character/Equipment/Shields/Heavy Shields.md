<center>MIDDLE GROUND DEFENSE</center>

---

Heavy shields occupy the middle ground between light and tower shields, blending parry-friendly design with a reliable defensive threshold. They provide better **coverage** and **stability** than smaller bucklers while demanding less Strength and stamina than massive tower shields. Often favored by disciplined front-liners, heavy shields bolster posture with balanced stamina use, making them a staple for well-rounded defenders.

## **Typical Forms**

- Larger Round Shields  
  Provide broad coverage of the torso and arms.  
  Often carry decorative or symbolic emblems.  
  Allow partial parries but emphasize direct blocking.

  
- Heater Shields  
  Characterized by a top curve and tapering down to a point.  
  Excel at deflecting strikes away from the body.  
  Commonly seen among knightly orders seeking moderate protection and heraldic display.

  
- Kite Shields  
  Extended shape covering much of the leg and body length.  
  Originally designed for cavalry, yet equally useful on foot.  
  Balanced posture management with superior coverage, especially for mid-limb defense.

## **Attributes and Mechanics**

- Strength Requirement  
  Heavy shields demand moderate Strength—enough to manage weight, anchor blocks, and reduce recoil from big impacts.  
  Characters with low Strength might suffer faster posture breaks or heavier stamina drain.

-  ​Posture and Stamina  
   Heavy shields strike the best compromise between light and tower shields when struck: block stability is higher than a buckler, but stamina usage remains reasonable.  
   Block-based talents often highlight heavy shields, allowing bashes that partially stagger foes.

  
- ​Encumbrance  
  While heavier than bucklers, they’re still more portable than tower shields, suiting adventurers who need robust defense without slow, encumbered movement.  
  Medium Armor synergy is common, ensuring a balanced approach to defense and mobility.

## **Combat Benefits**

- Reliable Protection  
  Enemies face consistent block angles and decent coverage.  
  Heavy shields excel at halting slashes or mid-range weapon thrusts, aiding in controlling the flow of melee engagements.

  
- Defensive Offense  
  Heavy shields usually have enough mass to deliver punishing shield bashes or charges.    While not as overwhelming as tower shield rams, the impact can disrupt or stagger foes, buying time for counterattacks or repositioning.

  
• Parry Viability  
  Although heavier than bucklers, well-timed blocks can still yield partial parries for those with enough Dexterity or Reflex synergy, though it’s less forgiving than a purely parry-focused shield.

  
**Use Cases**

-  Medium/Heavy Armor Knights  
   Sporting plate or chain with a heater shield for balanced defense and moderate mobility.  
   Ideal for front-line fighters who can’t afford a tower shield’s stamina toll yet want more coverage than a light shield.

  
-  Faith or Strength Hybrids  
   Clerics or paladins often rely on a heavy shield for warding posture. Combines with Faith-based spells for healing or smiting, ensuring front-line presence and group support.

  
- Versatility Warriors  
  Spear-and-shield combos benefit from a heavy shield’s coverage while retaining enough agility to handle counters. Heavy shields allow for flexible tactics: short thrusts, shield bashes, and stable blocks.
