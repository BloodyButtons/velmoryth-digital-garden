<center>THE DEFENSIVE BACKBONE</center>

---

In *Chronicle*, **Shields** serve as a **primary means** of defense across various playstyles- whether you’re a lightly armored rogue deflecting stray blows or a stalwart knight [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Blocking\|blocking]] a legion’s assaults. They come in three broad categories. **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Light Shields\|Light Shields]]**, **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Heavy Shields\|Heavy Shields]]**, and **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Tower Shields\|Tower Shields]]**, each of these are  designed to meet specific **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]** (and occasionally **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]]**) thresholds, [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]] usage levels, and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]] profiles. Below is a brief comparison, with each type to be detailed further in its own section.

---

## Light Shields

- **Examples**: Bucklers, small round shields, [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Parrying\|parrying]] daggers with shieldlike guards  

- **Role**: Used primarily for *parrying*, *quick blocks*, or *offensive deflections* rather than brute-force soaking.  

- **Attributes**: 
  
  - Low Strength requirement  
 
  - Minimal stamina drain  
 
  - Easy synergy with [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]/Reflex builds focusing on agile defense  

- **Encumbrance**: Low, easy to wield alongside a finesse weapon or wand/focus in the other hand

---

## Heavy Shields

- **Examples**: Larger round shields, kite shields, heater shields  

- **Role**: Balanced approach, providing **solid defense** without full immobility. Good for those who want to mitigate a decent amount of damage while still retaining moderate maneuverability.  

- **Attributes**: 

  - Moderate Strength requirement (often ~15-20 range)  

  - Increased stamina cost for extended blocking  
 
  - Works well with [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Medium Armor\|Medium Armor]] or Strength-based builds that rely on some mobility  

- **Encumbrance**: Medium weight; noticeably heavier than a light shield but doesn’t cripple movement like a tower shield

---

## Tower Shields

- **Examples**: Large rectangular or tower-like shields covering most of the body  

- **Role**: **Maximum defense**, turning the user into a near-impenetrable wall in the front line  

- **Attributes**:  
 
  - High Strength requirement (25+), occasional synergy with Vitality for stamina sustain  
 
  - Highest stamina usage, especially under repeated heavy impacts  

  - Best for tank archetypes, heavily armored guardians, or advanced STR-based paladins  

- **Encumbrance**: Very high; drastically limits agility and dodge frames, but massively reduces incoming damage if used correctly

## Comparative Table

| Shield Type   | Encumbrance | Strength Req.   | Stamina Drain | Defense Rating | Typical Use Case                           |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Light Shields | Low         | Low (~5–10)     | Low           | Lower, good for parrying or quick blocks  | Dexterity builds, agile fighters           |
| Heavy Shields | Medium      | Moderate (~15–20)| Medium       | Solid protection, balanced coverage       | STR-based knights, medium armor synergy    |
| Tower Shields | High        | High (25+)      | High          | Maximum block, near-full coverage         | Full tank roles, heavily armed warriors    |

### Summary

**Shields** in *Chronicle* revolve around a **trade-off** of **encumbrance**, **stamina cost**, and **defensive capacity**. Light shields cater to swift parriers, heavy shields fit the balanced fighter seeking reliable defense, and tower shields offer near-impenetrable safety at substantial stamina expense. By choosing the right shield class and meeting its Strength (and potentially Vitality) needs, players shape their frontline or evasive role in combat, merging synergy with attributes, gear loadouts, and playstyle preferences in the broader context of Velmoryth’s lethal challenges.
