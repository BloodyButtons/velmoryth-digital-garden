<center>TOOLS OF THE ADVENTURING TRADE</center> 

---

Equipment in *Chronicle* is divided into **thirteen distinct slots**, each contributing to your **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Item Level\|Item Level]] (IL)**, a reflection of your overall gear-based power. Items across these slots range from armor pieces (light, medium, or heavy) to weapons (one-handed, two-handed, versatile) and accessories (rings, amulets, quivers, etc.). The sum of each item’s IL composes your **total Item Level**, with the final number rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. This **Item Level** directly informs [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]] in conjunction with [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Character Level\|Character Level]], signifying how well-outfitted you are for the harsh challenges of Velmoryth.

## The Thirteen Slots

1. **Head**  
   
   - Hats, helms, hoods. Range from simple leather caps (light) to imposing steel helmets (heavy).

2. **Shoulders**  
   
   - Shoulder pads, cloak clasps, or mantles. Often enhance defense or load distribution.

3. **Chest & Arms**  
   
   - The core body armor piece, leather tunics, chainmail, or plate covering torso and upper limbs.

4. **Waist**  
   
   - Belts and sashes that may hold pouches, offer minor attribute buffs, or anchor gear.

5. **Gloves**  
   
   - Gauntlets, bracers, or nimble gloves. Often specialized for certain tasks, e.g., archery or spellcasting.

6. **Legs**  
  
   - Leg armor (greaves, pants, skirts). Ranges from minimal coverage (light) to bulky plating (heavy).

7. **Boots**  
  
   - Footwear that impacts mobility, traction, or stealth. Heavier boots add encumbrance but more protection.

8. **Ring**  
  
   - Magic or mundane rings for stat boosts, resistances, or specialized functions.

9. **Amulet**  
  
   - Neckwear granting various bonuses be it protective wards, elemental affinities, or spell enhancements.

10. **Quiver**  
 
   - Arrows or bolts storage. Some quivers grant bonuses to ranged damage, special ammo, or synergy with archery talents.

10. **Cape** / **Pack**
   
   - Cloaks or capes offering minimal defense but potential stealth, climate protection, or style-based buffs.

   - A pack does not offer any weather protection or room for extra enchantments, but instead allows the user to carry more supplies. A useful boon in the wilds.  

12. **Left Hand**  
  
   - Shields (light or heavy), **foci** (like wands or orbs), second weapon for dual-wielders, or staves used two-handed if not occupying Right Hand.

13. **Right Hand**  

   - Primary weapon slot: swords, maces, axes, bows, crossbows, wands, staves, etc.

> **Note:** Each item slot has an **Item Level**. Summed together, they produce a total IL (rounded to the nearest 10) that guides your overall gear-derived attributes.

## Armor Categories

**Armor** falls into three broad tiers, light, medium, and heavy, each with unique implications for **encumbrance**, **mobility**, and attribute synergy:

- **Light Armor**:  
  
  - Minimal defensive coverage; favored by stealthy or agile builds.  
 
  - Typically lower STR/VIT requirements, potential DEX/REF bonuses.

- **Medium Armor**:  
  
  - Balanced approach to protection and mobility.  

  - Often requires moderate STR + DEX to equip effectively; synergy for versatile builds.

- **Heavy Armor**:  
  
  - Maximum defense, higher weight.  
  
  - Demands sufficient Strength (or Vitality) to manage bulk and stamina drain.

## Weapons

1. **One-Handed**  
   
   - Swords, axes, maces- capable of pairing with a shield, focus, or second weapon in the off-hand.

2. **Two-Handed**  
   
   - Greatswords, greataxes, greathammers, slower but deliver high damage and posture breaks.

3. **Versatile**  
   
   - Spears, quarterstaves, flails that require synergy between Strength and Dexterity.

4. **Ranged**  
   
   - Bows, crossbows that often scale with Dexterity, sometimes minor Strength sub-scaling.  
  
   - Quiver slot used in tandem for ammo storage.

5. **Caster Implements**  
   
   - Wands, staves, orbs, foci used for **arcane** or **faith-based** spellcasting.  
 
   - Often require Intelligence or Faith thresholds, and can occupy either hand or both (two-handed staves).

---

## Accessory Items

- **Rings & Amulets**: Provide passive attribute boosts, resistances, or special effects (e.g., reduced fall damage, improved mana regen).

- **Capes**: Offer slight defensive or stealth bonuses, weather protection, or synergy with certain talents (like stealth or parrying).

- **Quiver**: Special slot for archers or crossbow users to store arrows/bolts; sometimes grants bonuses like elemental shots or increased crit chance.

## Item Level Mechanics

Each piece in the 13 slots has an **Item Level**, the higher its IL, the stronger (and often rarer) its bonuses or enchantments:

1. **Summation & Rounding**:  
   
   - Sum up every slot’s IL.  
   
   - Round to the nearest **multiple of 10** to get your total **Item Level**.

2. **Attribute Impact**:  
   
   - Items typically grant direct attribute bonuses or scale your existing stats. In conjunction with progression through active play, this allows the player to pivot their builds reliably and easily.
   
   - Stronger gear = higher attributes = access to better skills, spells, and equipment.  
   
   - Diminishing returns ensure balance at higher levels.

3. **Progression by Exploration**:  
   
   - In *Chronicle*, gear-based progression encourages delving into dangerous areas for advanced equipment or forging specialized items.  
   
   - The result is **organic growth**- your character becomes physically or magically more capable as you uncover and equip rarer items.

## Mundane vs. Enchanted Items

In *Chronicle*, every piece of equipment follows a simple yet versatile rule set: **one material trait** (the item’s core design) plus an optional **magical trait** (if enchanted). Many items remain purely mundane, granting basic benefits like warmth or slight armor, while others incorporate potent enchantments for additional or enhanced effects.

- **Mundane Items:** Rely on their inherent material—fur, cloth, iron, leather—to provide straightforward functionality. A fur cloak keeps you warm in the cold, or a steel breastplate defends against weapon strikes. These items remain crucial to everyday survival without complicating the build or requiring special thresholds.

- **Enchanted Items:** Possess an extra layer of magical augmentation—feather falling, elemental resistance, invisibility, etc. They’re rarer and demand higher thresholds or synergy with specific attributes (like Intelligence, Faith, or Mind) for maximum benefit. Combining both a **qualitative trait** (e.g., fur) and **magical trait** (e.g., embershield) forms archetypes like *Fur Cloak of Embershield*, granting both warmth and mild fire resistance.

Every item slot in the game, from headgear to rings, adheres to this **material + optional enchant** formula. This design ensures players have freedom to pursue purely mundane gear or chase after specialized, enchanted relics, aligning with *Chronicle*’s balance of **survival** and **fantasy** across Velmoryth. ***For development purposes, the more powerful an item the higher IL it will have.**

## Summary

Equipment in *Chronicle* is the **lifeblood** of your character’s power and identity. Thirteen slots, ranging from headgear to your right-hand weapon, collectively define your **Item Level**—the sum of your gear’s strength and enchantments. Light, medium, and heavy armors impact mobility and defense; myriad weapon classes shape how you fight; and accessories round out specialized bonuses or unique abilities. Understanding and optimizing your gear loadout becomes a central pillar of survival, growth, and mastery within the world of Velmoryth.
