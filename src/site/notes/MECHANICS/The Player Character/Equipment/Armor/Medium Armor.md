<center>A BALANCED DEFENSE</center>

---

**Medium Armor** in *Chronicle* straddles the line between the high mobility of [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Light Armor\|light armor]] and the heavy defense of full plate. By combining elements of **leather**, **chain**, and **reinforced metal plates**, it provides a robust protective layer without sacrificing too much agility. Medium [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]] is the favored choice for adventurers who want a **moderate [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]]** profile, reliable defense, and enough freedom of movement to avoid complete reliance on brute force.

---

## Composition & Visual Design

Medium armor pieces often integrate **layered textiles** (like leather or heavy cloth) with **metal segments** (chain links, small plates, riveted scales) placed over vital areas. Common examples include:

- **Brigandine**: Cloth or leather shells padded inside with small metal plates.  
- **Chainmail Vest**: Interlocking metal rings layered atop leather padding, offering decent cut and puncture protection.  
- **Scale/Lamellar Armor**: Overlapping scales or lamella plates attached to a flexible backing—still less cumbersome than a full steel cuirass.

| Armor Type         | Typical Materials       | Visual / Style                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Brigandine Jacket  | Leather + riveted plates | A sleeved torso piece, partially flexible       |
| Chain Hauberk      | Interlocking ring mesh   | Covers torso and arms, worn over padding        |
| Scale Vest         | Stacked metal scales     | Securely laced to cloth or hide, moderate weight|

## Attribute Influence

1. **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] & [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]**  
   
   - Medium armor typically requires **moderate [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]** to handle the additional weight, though not as intensively as heavy plate.  
  
   - **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]** synergy can remain viable—especially in chain- or scale-based sets that preserve partial agility. Ideal for versatile fighters who don’t want to fully sacrifice mobility.

2. **Vitality**  
  
   - [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]] assists with **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]]** management under prolonged battles or travel with moderate encumbrance. Characters in medium armor rely on slightly higher VIT to endure if the fight demands frequent blocks or sprints.

3. **Reflexes**  
   
   - Some medium armors hamper [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Dodging\|dodging]] less drastically than heavy plate, enabling builds that combine moderate reflex-based evasion with a stable defense.

##  Survival & Exploration

### Moderate Encumbrance, Balanced Mobility

- **Encumbrance**: Medium sets weigh more than leather or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Robes\|robes]], but far less than steel plate, retaining a decent **travel speed** and **stamina usage** ratio.  

- **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|Temperature]] Considerations**: Offers moderate warmth, can be layered for cold climates, while chain-based sets might cause overheating in scorching deserts unless supplemented with potions or spells.

### Defensive Reliability

- **Damage Mitigation**: Protects effectively against slashes and some blunt trauma. While not impervious to heavy hits, it reduces reliance on nimble evasion alone.  

- **Sustained Travel**: Adventurers crossing rugged or monster-filled territories benefit from the middle-ground approach: robust enough to handle stray blows without crippling movement.

## Combat Applications

### Hybrid Offense/Defense

Medium armor suits **all-rounder builds** who mix offense with enough defense to survive direct hits. Typically:

- **Spears, Flails, or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Versatility/Versatility\|Versatility]] Weapons**: Spear-wielding rangers or halberd-carrying defenders who want moderate armor synergy for balanced Strength/Dex synergy.  

- **Ranged & Melee**: Characters who alternate between ranged attacks and short-range engagements can rely on medium [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]]’s sturdiness when switching to close quarters.

### [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|Posture]] & Stamina

- Medium armor reduces **stamina drain** less than light armor but more than heavy sets—this middle ground allows you to continue offensive combos or block effectively without quickly fatiguing.  

- Pairs well with mid-level **Vitality** or moderate **Reflexes**, letting you handle a variety of combat scenarios (e.g., partial dodging, partial [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Blocking\|blocking]]).

### Example Use Case:  
**A Brigandine-clad Ranger** with a spear and shortbow can flex between melee stabs and ranged potshots, maintaining enough armor to weather small skirmishes while not losing the capacity to outrun or outmaneuver heavier foes.

## Visual Data & Examples

| Armor Name           | IL Range | Requirements                 | Notes                                        |
|----------------------|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Chain Hauberk**    | 10–20    | STR 10–15, maybe DEX 10      | Offers balanced slash/pierce defense         |
| **Scaled Vest**      | 15–25    | STR 15–20                    | Adds partial plating over vital spots        |
| **Brigandine Jacket**| 20–30    | STR 15–20, minimal DEX needed| Good vs. physical hits, flexible panels      |
| **Lamellar Harness** | 25–35    | STR 20+, synergy w/ VIT      | Sturdy coverage, heavier but still not full plate |

- **Encumbrance**: Medium

- **Mobility**: Moderate  

- **Stamina Usage**: Greater than light, less than heavy  

- **Climate Suitability**: Reasonable in temperate or mild conditions, can be augmented with cloaks for colder areas.

## Use Cases & Archetypes

1. **Spear & Shield Hoplite**  
   
   - STR ~15, DEX ~10.  
   
   - Wears a chain mail shirt or brigandine, balancing spear thrusts with partial shield coverage.  
  
   - Gains reliable defense while still controlling the battlefield with moderate agility.

2. **Battle Cleric**  
 
   - Faith-based warrior in scale mail, combining melee presence with divine spells.  
  
   - Enough STR to carry mail, enough [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|Faith]] to smite or heal, bridging offense and support.

3. **Scout Skirmisher**  
 
   - DEX + VIT build wearing light chain. Moves faster than a heavy knight, but can endure more than a typical light-armored rogue.  
  
   - Great for extended missions in uncertain territory—carrying moderate supplies, not slowed by heavy metal plates.

## Summary

Medium armor stands as the **middle ground** between the minimal constraints of light sets and the formidable bulk of heavy plating. It pairs well with characters who need **versatility**, capable of fending off direct assaults while preserving decent stamina usage and some agility. From chain vests to brigandine jackets, each piece ensures dependable defense with balanced encumbrance, making it a top choice for **all-rounders** and **hybrid fighters** seeking resilience without fully abandoning dexterity or mobility.
