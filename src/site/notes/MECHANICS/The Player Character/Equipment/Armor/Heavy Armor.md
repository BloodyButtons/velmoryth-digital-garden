<center>The Bulwark of Brute Defense</center>

---

**Heavy Armor** in *Chronicle* marks the apex of physical protection, enveloping the wearer in robust metal plating or similarly dense materials. While it grants unparalleled **damage mitigation** and **poise**, it exacts a toll on **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]]**, **mobility**, and attribute requirements. Built for those who plan to stand unyielding against onslaughts- knights, paladins, and juggernauts. Heavy armor embodies the hard-hitting, frontline style of tackling Velmoryth’s deadliest threats.

## Composition & Visual Design

Heavy [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]] typically features **metal plating**, **tempered steel**, or **exotic alloys** layered with internal padding. Some examples:

- **Full Plate**: Interlocking steel plates covering the entire body, torso, arms, legs, and helm often richly embellished with crests or runes.  

- **Splint Armor**: Vertical metal strips riveted to a cloth or leather backing, providing sturdy coverage with slightly more flexibility than solid plate.  

- **Banded Mail**: Overlapping horizontal metal bands over chainmail, bridging chain’s agility with plate’s [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Defensive/Defensive\|defensive]] coverage.

| Heavy Armor Type   | Materials                               | Visual / Style                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Full Plate         | Forged steel plates + padded underlayer | Massive coverage, knights or paladins        |
| Splint Armor       | Metal strips on leather backing         | Semi-modular, a bit easier to don/doff       |
| Banded Mail        | Horizontal metal bands layered on chain | Balanced approach but still quite heavy      |

## Attribute Influence

### Strength (STR)

- **Primary Requirement**: Heavy armor demands notable [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] to handle its sheer weight without crippling stamina usage. Characters below recommended thresholds incur:
  
  - Higher **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]] penalties**  
 
  - Slower movement/dodge frames  
 
  - Possibly partial coverage (ineffectively wearing it)  

- **Synergy**: Tank-like classes (**STR + VIT** or **STR + FTH** for paladins) benefit from massive defense and unstoppable presence.

### Vitality (VIT)

- **Secondary Requirement**: [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]] helps sustain prolonged battles under the burden of heavy gear.  

- **Stamina & Fatigue Mitigation**: High VIT ensures you don’t tire quickly from heavy plate, blocking, or extended engagements.

### [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] & [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Reflexes\|Reflexes]]

- Typically overshadowed by heavy armor’s weight. Light or moderate Dex/Ref builds find synergy more in medium or light sets.  

- Some partial synergy might exist if you’d like to keep minimal mobility, **Dex** can slightly reduce how severely you’re penalized for movement in heavy gear, but it’s rarely the main strategy.

## Survival & Exploration

### Protective Juggernaut

- **Damage Soak**: Heavy armor significantly reduces physical hits, diminishing bleeds or blunt trauma.  

- **Tanking Role**: In group scenarios, heavy-armored characters can spearhead expeditions, absorbing ambush hits or facing apex predators with relative safety.

### Encumbrance & Mobility

- **Harsher Stamina Drain**: Extended travel or climbing in full plate is punishing. Players require good supplies, rest stops, and sometimes *mule or cart usage* for extremely long treks.  

- **Environment Sensitivity**: Heat or desert conditions amplify [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]]. Using heavy plate in scorching dunes is viable only if you have cooling magic or robust survival gear.

### Potential [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|Temperature]] Issues

- **Overheating**: In hot climates, wearing steel around the clock can be lethal. Many choose partial gear sets (breastplate but no leggings) to balance the environment’s toll.

## Combat Applications

### Frontline Resilience

- **Block & [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|Posture]]**: High poise means you can endure or deflect incoming blows without staggering easily. Coupling with a **tower shield** or heavier weapons leads to unstoppable charges or stable phalanx tactics.  

- **Reduced Dexterity Reliance**: Heavy armor counters the necessity for perfect dodges by letting you soak hits, but you remain vulnerable to repeated or powerful strikes if your stamina depletes.

### Aggressive Defense

- **Slow & Methodical**: Trading speed for security, heavy-armor warriors focus on big, punishing swings with enough stamina to absorb counters.  

- **Synergy with [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|Faith]]**: Paladin or Cleric-style builds who wield heavy plate can cast healing or ward invocations while surviving in melee range.

### Example: A Knight in Full Plate

| Armor Name        | IL Range | STR Req.  | VIT Synergy | Defense Rating | Movement Penalty |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| Knight’s Plate    | 20–30    | 15–20 STR | Medium      | High           | Moderate         |
| Warforged Aegis   | 30–40    | 20–25 STR | High        | Very High      | High             |
| Dragonsteel Cuirass| 40–50   | 25+ STR   | High        | Extremely High | Very High        |

*(Movement penalty includes stamina drain, slower dodges or rolls, etc.)*

## 5. Use Cases & Archetypes

1. **Tower Shield Guardian**  
  
   - STR + VIT build uses a massive shield and a sturdy weapon. Heavily invests in posture-based defense and group protection.  

1. **Smiting Paladin**  
   - STR + Faith synergy, wearing luminous plate. Provides heavy frontline presence while casting healing bursts or smiting [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Race/Undead\|undead]] with unstoppable fervor.  

1. **Arcane Juggernaut (Niche)**  
  
   - STR + INT build adopting lesser movement spells or illusions to offset slow speed, bridging brute force with arcane might (though typically less common given the high attribute demands).

## Summary

**Heavy Armor** is the prime choice for characters seeking **maximum survivability** in face-to-face confrontations. Forged from durable metals and layered with protective underlays, it demands serious Strength (and some Vitality) to wield effectively, limiting agility but compensating with robust damage mitigation. For those unafraid to trade speed for unmatched resilience, be it stalwart knights, devout paladins, or unstoppable “tank” archetypes, heavy armor stands as the ultimate bulwark against Velmoryth’s fiercest perils.
