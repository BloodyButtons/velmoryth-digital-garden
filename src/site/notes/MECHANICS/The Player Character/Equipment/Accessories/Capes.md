<center>AN ACCESSORY OF UTILITY AND FLAIR</center> 

---
# Temperature and Utility

Capes (or cloaks) occupy an **accessory slot** dedicated to **mobility**, **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|temperature]] management**, and **mild defensive or utility benefits**. Unlike heavy chest [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]] they usually add little direct protection, though they can be vital for **survival** in harsh climates or **supportive** in [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Stealth\|Stealth]] or combat scenarios. Whether you’re covering yourself in thick fur against subzero winds or using a lightweight cloth shawl in arid deserts, choosing the right cape can make or break an expedition.

## Temperature Control & Survival

- **Cold Protection**: A fur-lined or padded cloak can stave off the worst of Velmoryth’s frigid biomes. Coupled with high [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]], it becomes essential for trekking across snowy passes.  

- **Heat Adaptation**: Lighter capes (e.g., thin cloth or silk) help regulate body heat in sweltering regions, delaying dehydration penalties or [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]] buildup.  

- **Minimal [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|Encumbrance]]**: Most capes weigh considerably less than armor pieces, preserving stamina and movement speed for extended journeys.

## Combat & Movement Bonuses

- **Mobility & Stealth**: Some capes are cut specifically to reduce drag, assist in acrobatic maneuvers, or dampen noise. High [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] or Reflex users often pair agile cloaks with their builds.  

- **Synergy with Armors**: While heavy plate focuses on raw defense, a complementary cloak can provide mild environmental coverage or slight stealth edges, bridging the gap between fortitude and flexibility.  

- **Defensive Layers**: A thick fur cloak or reinforced back mantle can mitigate minor environmental damage (like ash storms or biting winds), though it won’t match dedicated armor for direct blows.

## Sample Cape Variations

- **Fur Cloak**: High warmth, moderate weight, preferred in icy realms.  

- **Leather Shawl**: Moderate insulation and water resistance, suits mid-range climates or rainy expeditions.  

- **Cloth Hooded Cape**: Very lightweight, minimal encumbrance- practical for stealthy travelers or desert wanderers.  

- **Reinforced Mantle**: Slightly heavier, merges some defensive plating for partial coverage without losing mobility.

### Summary

Capes in *Chronicle* serve as a **complementary accessory** to armor, focusing on **temperature regulation** and **maneuvering advantages**. They allow you to adapt to wildly varying biomes or environmental hazards while preserving freedom of movement, particularly valued by characters who rely on agility, stealth, or survival cunning in Velmoryth’s unpredictable wilderness.
