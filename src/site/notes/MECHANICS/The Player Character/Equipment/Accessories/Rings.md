# Subtle Enhancers

**Rings** in *Chronicle* occupy an **accessory slot** akin to [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Accessories/Amulets\|amulets]], delivering **attribute boosts**, **protective enchantments**, or even rare **active skills** for those fortunate enough to unearth legendary bands. While typically smaller and less conspicuous than [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Accessories/Capes\|capes]] or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]], rings can dramatically shape a character’s capabilities—often stacking complementary bonuses with other gear pieces.

## Core Functions

1. **Attribute Bonuses**  
   - Many rings provide **+1 to +3** (or more at higher IL) to a key attribute ([[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Mind\|Mind]], etc.).  
   - These increments can break important thresholds for heavier gear usage or advanced spell requirements, or simply round out a specialized build.

2. **Protective Enchantments**  
   - Rings can host **elemental or physical resistance**, e.g., minor fire or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Bleed\|bleed]] resistance.  
   - Some grant blanket defenses like *Arcane Shielding*, dampening a portion of incoming magical damage.

3. **Active Skills (Rare)**  
   - Certain high-tier or legendary rings bestow once-per-cooldown abilities:  
   
	 - **Ward Shield**: Summons a brief protective barrier.  
 
	 - **Ghoststep**: Grants momentary intangibility or rapid evasion.  
   
	 - **Blood Pact**: Sacrifices a portion of [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|health]] to amplify damage for a few seconds.

These rarer rings often require higher Intelligence, [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|Faith]], or Mind to operate safely—reflecting the intense concentration or spiritual command needed to activate their magic.

## Item Level & Attribute Thresholds

Similar to other gear:

- **Rings contribute to total [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Item Level\|Item Level]] (IL)**, which sums across all 13 equipment slots.  

- Higher IL rings typically offer stronger or multiple enchantments, albeit with potential attribute requirements or synergy conditions.

**Example**:  

- A **Ring of Minor Protection (IL 10)** might grant +2 [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]] and reduce physical damage by 5%.  

- An **Ebon Flame Signet (IL 40)** may provide +5 Intelligence, a moderate fire resist, and an active *Fire Ward* skill.

## Interplay with Other Systems

### Combat & Survival

- **Enhance a Build**: Rings with +Dex can tip the scales for faster [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Weapon Tempo\|weapon tempo]], or a ring with +STR could enable heavier gear usage or the next skill tier.  

- **Damage Mitigation**: Minor or moderate protection enchantments on rings stack with armor or amulet defenses, providing a layered approach to survival.

### Crafting & Upgrades

- Often forged or refined by **jewelers** or **enchanters**, rings can evolve from a mundane band into a specialized relic if the player invests in advanced materials or discovers rare sigils.  

- Legendary rings may require specific reagents from boss creatures or arcane rituals performed at hidden shrines.

### Attribute Synergy

- **Mind** or **Faith** synergy: Some rings require higher mental or spiritual strength to sustain protective auras or active skill triggers.  

- **Vitality** synergy: Heavier rings with physical-based enchantments might weigh slightly more, reflecting a small stamina or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]] cost.

## Summary

Rings might be **small**, but their impact on a character’s **attributes**, **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Defensive/Defensive\|Defensive]] layers**, and even **offensive capabilities** can be immense. Whether granting a subtle +2 to Strength, a burst of arcane protection, or a once-per-encounter spell-like effect, rings give players the flexibility to refine or revolutionize their playstyle—often with just a single slot. If amulets are the banner of a character’s role, rings provide the finishing touches, accentuating the hero’s unique path in *Chronicle*.
