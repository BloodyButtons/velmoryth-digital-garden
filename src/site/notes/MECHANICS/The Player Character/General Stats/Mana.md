<center>THE RESERVOIR OF MAGICAL POWER</center>

---

In *Chronicle* every spell- whether an Arcane Firebolt, a Psionic Mind‑spike, or a Holy [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Invocation/Invocation\|Invocation]], draws from a single **Mana pool**. Mana is to magic what [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|Health]] is to flesh: expend it recklessly and you risk exhaustion or mis‑casts; conserve it and you can bend Velmoryth’s reality to your will.

---

### Calculation & Growth

Mana is derived primarily from **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Mind\|Mind]] (MIN)** and secondarily from **gear bonuses** ([[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Magical Implements/Focii\|Focii]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Holy Implements/Catalysts\|Catalysts]], enchanted circlets, etc.). [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] determines a spell’s raw power, but **Mind governs how much fuel you possess and how many spells you can hold ready**.

<center>Base MP  =  40 + (Mind × 6) + Gear Bonus</center> 

<center>Spell Slots = (Mind ÷ 6) + Racial / Talent Adjustments</center>

| Mind | Base MP | Spell Slots* |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 6    | 76      | 1            |
| 8    | 88      | 2            |
| 10   | 100     | 3            |
| 12   | 112     | 4            |
| 14   | 124     | 5            |
| 16   | 136     | 6            |
| 18   | 148     | 7            |
| 20   | 160     | 8            |

\*A *spell slot* holds one memorised spell; casters store more spells beyond this limit in a spellbook from which they can pick and choose their memorized spells. Higher tiers of spellbook can hold more spells.

**Gear Bonus examples**  

* Minor Orb of Focus + 8 MP  

* Wizard’s Circlet + 1 spell slot  

* High‑tier Arcane Foci + 12 MP & + 2 % regen rate

###  Drain & Expenditure

| Spell Tier | Mana Cost | Typical Usage |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Cantrip (A) | 2–4 MP   | Utility sparks, Mage Light, minor wards |
| Standard (B)| 8–15 MP  | Firebolts, Healing Touch, Psionic Push |
| Advanced (C)| 20–35 MP | Fireball, Mass Heal, Hexblast |
| Signature (S)| 50–70 MP | Meteor Shower, Sanctuary Dome |

* Over‑casting below 10 % MP risks **Mis‑Cast** (spell fizzles and inflicts [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]]).  
* Invocations and Psionics share the same pool but may gain [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]] that reduce their specific costs.

### Regeneration & Recovery

| Method              | MP Restored          | Conditions / Trade‑offs                    |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Passive Regen**   | 2 % Max MP per minute (out of combat) | Regen halves during combat. |
| **Meditation**      | 20 % Max MP per minute | Requires safe spot or Sanctified Ground.    |
| **Mana Potion**     | 25 / 50 / 100 MP     | Consumes potion; subject to cooldown.       |
| **Arcane Well**     | Full                 | Rare world object; may trigger events.      |
| **Mind Salve**      | +3 % MP regen for 30 m| Crafted via Alchemy Kit.                    |

---

###  Survival Interactions

* **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|Thirst]]**: At Moderate dehydration max MP is reduced 10 %; Severe dehydration 25 %.  

* **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|Fatigue]]**: Sleeping restores MP faster; low sleep reduces regen by half.  

* **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Temperature\|Temperature]]**: Extreme cold slows regen; extreme heat increases Mis‑Cast chance.  

* **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Disease\|Disease]]**: Afflictions like “Mind Rot” halve the spell‑slot limit until cured.

---

###  Combat & Tactical Use

* **Spell Slots vs. Scrolls** - Slots let you cast without scrolls but risk draining MP; scrolls bypass slot count yet cost gold or crafting time.  

* **Hybrid Builds** - STR/DEX combatants with low‑mid Mind (8–10) can keep a clutch heal or utility charm without heavy investment.  

* **Mana Shield Talents** - High‑Mind mages can redirect a percentage of incoming damage to MP, sacrificing casting longevity for survivability.  

* **Cooldown Synergy** - Big spells have cooldowns; MP pool governs *how many* different big spells you can unleash in a single engagement.

---

### Practical Tips

* **Carry at least two Mana potions** for boss runs; mis‑casts mid‑fight can be fatal.  

* Undead gain no natural MP regen in daylight; plan spell usage for night excursions or shaded dungeons.  

* Machinations lack an inherent MP penalty but must juggle Soul‑Cage maintenance- balance magic use and repair cycles.  

* Cold regions? Bring Emberwine: +10 % MP regen, warmth, but slight dehydration tick.  

* High‑Mind does *not* equal high spell damage, that remains [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|Faith]] territory; spec accordingly.

### Summary

Mana is the currency of every mystical interaction in *Chronicle*.  
Mind supplies the reservoir, gear augments it, survival states choke or empower it, and intelligent combat pacing ensures you never face a charging war‑goat with an empty tank.  
Hone your will, weigh each spell, and remember: power unfettered is power exhausted just when Velmoryth demands it most.
