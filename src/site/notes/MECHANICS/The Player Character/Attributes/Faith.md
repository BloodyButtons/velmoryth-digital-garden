<center>THE POWER OF DEVOTION</center> 

---

**Faith** represents a character’s spiritual fervor, binding them to divine or unholy powers that transcend mundane magical arts. Where Intelligence focuses on arcane study, Faith centers on **belief**- channeling higher (or darker) energies into devastating or restorative [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Invocation/Invocation\|Invocation]]. Faith-wielders become conduits for primal forces beyond mere mortal comprehension, from righteous smiting to corrupt hexes.

## Detailed Mechanical Effects – Invocations & Scaling

Faith directly governs the **damage**, **healing potency**, and **efficacy** of Holy (or Dark) [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Invocation/Invocation\|Invocation]], as well as certain weapon enchantments bound to a divine or profane source.

### Invocation Potency

- **Offensive Invocations** (e.g., [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Faith Talents/Verric Bolt\|Verric Bolt]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Faith Talents/Faelid Wrath\|Faelid Wrath]]) scale heavily with Faith, increasing both **raw damage** and **area of effect** based on the caster’s devotion.  

- **Defensive or Restorative Invocations** (e.g., [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Faith Talents/Khaltic Hexbrand\|Khaltic Hexbrand]]’s curses, healing prayers) see improved **healing throughput**, **status cure rates**, or **protective ward durations** at higher Faith values.

> *Example:* A Holy Smite with **C-tier Faith scaling** might do +20-30% bonus damage at moderate FTH, while a higher-tier “S” scaling invocation could reach +60-80% for truly devout characters.

### Mana & Spiritual Efficiency

Though Faith-based magic does not always use classic [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Mana\|mana]] in the same sense as arcane spells, high Faith reduces **mana drain** alongside [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] or **invocation [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Cooldowns\|cooldowns]]**. Characters can sustain chants and boons longer before spiritual exhaustion sets in.

### Holy vs. Dark Path Variation

Some Faith abilities hinge on a more corrupted or unholy route:

- **Dark Invocations** (Hexes, Curses) exploit negative energies, draining foes or unleashing vile effects, still scaling from Faith.  

- **Holy Prayers** revolve around healing, smiting [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Race/Undead\|undead]], or shielding allies, also tied to Faith for magnitude.

## Equipment Thresholds & Interaction

While Intelligence-based casters rely on arcane gear, Faith-based characters require **divine or unholy implements** such as:

| Equipment Type       | Typical FTH Requirement | Notes                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Holy Symbol / Relic  | 10-20 FTH               | Basic invocation focus for prayers                          |
| Censer / Chalice     | 15-25 FTH               | Used in group healing rituals or blessings                  |
| Dark Tome / Talisman | 20-30 FTH               | Hex or curse focus, unholy route                            |
| Blessed Armaments    | 15-35 FTH               | Weapons that scale with Faith (e.g., relic swords or maces) |

- Equipping relics beyond your Faith threshold results in **weakened or unstable Invocations**: partial heals, halved smite damage, or significant recoil upon usage.  

- High-level Faith gear typically grants **divine buffs**, from improved healing rates to enemy-specific damage bonuses (like extra smiting damage vs. undead).

## Talents or Skills Affected

A wide array of Faith-based skills populate the **Invocations** skill class, plus certain sub-trees in **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Defensive/Defensive\|Defensive]]** or **Tactica**:


- **Blessing [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|Talents]]**: Provide passive auras (e.g., subtle HP regen, anti-undead auras).  

- **Invocation Mastery**: Accelerates invocation cast times, lessens focus cost, and extends duration of blessings.  

- **Necrotic / Hex Path**: Characters with high Faith can focus on hexes that sap life or manipulate undead.  

**Hard Requirements** often appear on advanced talents, for instance  a high-tier healing talent might require 30+ Faith, ensuring only the devout can mend grievous wounds in mid-combat.

## Combat & Survival Interactions

### Combat

1. **Diverse Damage Types**  
   
   - Holy or Unholy damage can bypass many conventional defenses, ideal for fighting arcane creatures or undead.  
   
   - Large AoE smites or curses can swing encounters swiftly, ensuring Faith-wielders fill dynamic roles in parties.

2. **Ally Support**  
   
   - Faith-based characters often buff allies with protective wards, cure status ailments, and replenish [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|vitality]] mid-battle.  
   
   - Tank-based builds (STR + VIT + FTH) combine unwavering frontline presence with potent group sustain.

3. **Self-Healing & Status Cleansing**  
   
   - Survive harsher climates or diseases through specialized prayers or ritual castings that reduce the toll of environment-driven stress.

### Survival

1. **Reduced Reliance on Standard Consumables**  
   
   - Faith players can create or cast healing boons or purifications that partially replace rations or potions, easing [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|hunger]] and [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|thirst]] burdens if the invocation specifically addresses them.

2. **Narrow Resource**  
   
   - Overusing Faith-based abilities strains a spiritual focus or special resource (Focus / Devotion / an internal well of piety). Improper pacing in survival situations can leave you vulnerable if you can’t recast a crucial ward.

3. **Undead & Corruption**  
   
   - Undead, demonic, or cursed zones react strongly to Faith-based energies. High Faith characters excel at **exorcising** miasma or banishing corruption from shrines or crypts- functions that can single-handedly open new exploration routes.

## Summary

Faith stands apart as the conduit to **divine or unholy power** capable of miracles no arcane or physical might can replicate. Whether smiting undead legions, mending life-threatening wounds, or chanting a corruption-laced hex, Faith-based characters wield powers that transcend mortal limitations. Tied to specialized relics and devout gear, Faith scales with devotion, forging unstoppable crusaders or dreadful occultists who reshape battles and banish the deepest darkness.
