<center>THE EMBODIMENT OF DOMINATION </center>

---

**Strength** is the measure of raw physical power. It governs your ability to wield heavy weapons, break through obstacles, wear heavy armor, and perform feats of sheer brute force. In *Chronicle*, Strength isn't just about hitting harder, it's about **meeting thresholds**, and **physically overcoming the world itself.**

---
## Damage & Scaling

Strength directly governs the **base and scaling damage** of all *Martial* weapons. These include:


- One-Handed & Two-Handed Swords  

- Maces, Mauls, and Clubs  

- Greathammers & Greataxes  

- Flails, Polearms (shared with [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] under *Versatility*)  

- Tower [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Shields\|Shields]] (as an equip requirement) 

---

### Weapon Scaling Tiers

Every [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Martial/Martial\|Martial]] weapon has a **scaling grade**, which determines how much bonus damage is added based on your Strength value.

| STR Scaling Grade | Required STR | Bonus Damage Multiplier |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| E (Poor)          | 5-10         | +5% to 10%              |
| D (Mediocre)      | 11-20        | +10% to 20%             |
| C (Moderate)      | 21-30        | +20% to 30%             |
| B (Strong)        | 31-40        | +30% to 45%             |
| A (High)          | 41-50        | +45% to 60%             |
| S (Exceptional)   | 51+          | +60% to 80%             |

*Scaling is calculated after base weapon damage and item quality, then modified further by talents, posture damage, and world level difficulty.*

---

### Dual-Handing Bonus

Two-handing a Martial weapon applies an additional **+15% effective STR** for the purposes of **meeting requirements** and **scaling**, but not attribute checks.  

> Example: A character with 30 STR two-handing a greathammer will scale as if they had 34.5 STR for damage.

---

### Posture Damage Contribution

- STR-based weapons deal **bonus [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|Posture]] damage** when swung at full [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|Stamina]].

- Higher STR reduces the **posture cost** of blocking heavy weapons.

- Heavy weapons with high STR scaling can **break enemy posture faster**, especially if timed with stamina exhaustion windows.

---

### Knockback & Momentum

At high Strength thresholds, certain weapons can **stagger lighter enemies**, disrupt charging attacks, or even send foes flying on critical hits. This knockback is **modified by Strength + Weapon Weight**.

---

### STR & Weapon Durability

- High STR users reduce the **rate of durability loss** on heavy weapons, meaning they break less often with consistent use.

- Conversely, under-leveled STR characters using gear above their capacity will experience **faster durability degradation** and lower effective damage.

---

## Equipment Thresholds & Interaction

Strength is a **hard requirement** for equipping many Martial weapons and the heaviest [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|Armor]] sets in *Chronicle*. It ensures that only characters who have physically developed their power through action, gear, and training can wield the tools of brute force.

---

### Weapon Thresholds

Martial weapons (and some [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Versatility/Versatility\|Versatility]]-class items) have **minimum Strength requirements** based on their weight, type, and [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Item Level\|Item Level]].

| Weapon Type          | Typical STR Requirement Range |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| One-Handed Swords    | 10-25 STR                     |
| Greatswords          | 25-45 STR                     |
| Greathammers / Mauls | 30-50 STR                     |
| Tower Shields        | 35-50 STR                     |
| Flails / Polearms    | 20-40 STR (also require DEX)  |

> Attempting to use a weapon above your STR threshold:
> 
> - Greatly reduces swing speed  
> - Severely penalizes damage scaling  
> - Increases stamina cost  
> - Greatly increases posture damage received on block  
> - May cause weapon to stagger the player on impact or backfire  
> - May result in dropped guard/parry failure

---

### Armor Thresholds

Heavy armor pieces also require minimum Strength to equip effectively. These thresholds are typically **less punishing** than weapon thresholds, but still critical for characters expecting to tank damage or maintain poise.

| Armor Class   | Typical STR Requirement |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Light         | None or 5-10 STR        |
| Medium        | 10-25 STR               |
| Heavy         | 25-40 STR               |
| Tower Shields | 35-50 STR               |

> Wearing armor above your STR threshold:
> 
> - Increases stamina drain from movement and combat  
> - Slows dodge animation and may disable dodge entirely  
> - Increases **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|Fatigue]]** rate during travel  
> - May prevent full use of [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]] requiring mobility or finesse  
> - Reduces effective poise and defense value

---

### STR-Based Scaling on Gear Bonuses

As characters equip higher item level weapons and armor:

- **Strength increases proportionally** if the item is tagged with STR scaling.

- This creates a **snowball effect** where better STR gear → higher STR → access to stronger STR gear.

- However, since item level caps at 500 and attributes experience **soft scaling curves**, characters must still invest in proper **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Skills And Talents\|Skills And Talents]]** to fully maximize power.

---

### Versatility Weapons

Some weapons like spears, quarterstaves, and flails require a combination of Strength **and** Dexterity. These **Versatility weapons** reward players who balance raw power with technique.

> Example: A spear may require 20 STR and 20 DEX to wield effectively, scaling with both stats.

---
## Talents or Skills Affected

Strength plays a foundational role in determining what **skills and talents** a character can learn and use effectively within the **Martial** and **Versatility** trees.

---

### Skills Requiring Strength

Strength is the **primary attribute** for all Martial-class skills and a **partial scaler** for many Versatility-class skills. These skills focus on:


- Brutal melee attacks  

- Guard-breaking swings  

- Weapon-based knockbacks or staggers  

- High-impact charged blows  

- Heavy shield maneuvers (bashes, reposts)

> Example Skills:
> 
> - **Crushing Blow**; A two-handed overhead swing that deals massive posture damage.  
>  
> - **Shield Ram**; A tower shield charge that knocks enemies prone.  
> 
> - **Cleaving Arc**; Sweeps across multiple enemies with a greatsword or axe.

These skills typically scale in **damage, stagger chance, and execution speed** with higher Strength values.

---

### Versatility Skills

Versatility skills (like those involving **spears, halberds, flails**, and **quarterstaves**) often have **dual attribute requirements**, usually Strength and Dexterity.  

The higher your Strength, the more reliable and impactful the **damage and posture output** of these skills.

---

### Talents Requiring Strength

Many talents- particularly in the **Martial** tree, have **minimum Strength thresholds**. These passives enhance a character’s ability to wield weapons of war, mitigate incoming damage, and punish overextended foes.

> Example Talents:
> 
> - **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Martial/Iron Grip\|Iron Grip]]**;  Prevents disarm attempts and reduces stamina damage from [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Blocking\|blocking]] with heavy weapons. *(15 STR minimum)*  
> 
> - **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Martial/Bloodspiller\|Bloodspiller]]**; Increases posture damage and grants a minor bleed effect on heavy weapon crits. *(25 STR minimum)*  
> 
> - **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Martial/Unrelenting Guard\|Unrelenting Guard]]**; Reduces posture damage taken while blocking with a tower shield. *(30 STR minimum)*

Some **cross-class talents** (such as those in Versatility or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Defensive/Defensive\|Defensive]]) may also require a minimum Strength to activate more durable forms of defense or tactics that rely on brute force.

---

### Talent Synergy and Hybrid Builds

Though Strength is often associated with tanky or heavy-hitting builds, certain talents open the door to **hybridization** with Dexterity, [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Vitality\|Vitality]], or even [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|Faith]].

- A **STR + VIT** build might combine martial might with the **Heavy Armor** or **Shield Mastery** talent sets.  

- A **STR + FTH** build could focus on **blessed greathammers** and faith-based crowd control.  

- A **STR + REF** build might take advantage of **counter-attack mechanics** and heavier flails or stagger-based timing weapons.

---

### Learning and Unlocking

Strength is raised through;

- **Performing relevant actions** or training with an [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Instructors\|Instructor]] 
- **Purchased from skill instructors** (provided you meet the attribute threshold)

Having sufficient Strength doesn't auto-grant talents but it **unlocks the possibility** of learning them as your character develops.

## Combat & Survival Interactions

Strength doesn't just increase raw damage, it actively **shapes part of the feel and rhythm of combat** and has profound effects on a character’s ability to survive the harsh, physical demands of Velmoryth.

---

### Combat Interactions

In battle, Strength manifests in more than just heavy hits:

- **Posture Damage**; High-Strength characters deal greater posture damage, allowing them to break guards and shatter enemy defenses more quickly. Strong weapons (when properly wielded) can interrupt attacks and stagger lighter foes, enabling more aggressive playstyles.

- **Blocking Power** – Strength increases blocking efficiency with [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Heavy Shields\|Heavy Shields]] and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Tower Shields\|Tower Shields]] reducing stamina and posture loss when guarding, this also includes two-handed weapons.

- **Parry Stability**; Strength stabilizes a player’s parries against larger weapons, allowing them to absorb impact more reliably without recoil. For example, someone with higher strength may be able to parry a hit from a greatsword-wielding for where other characters might not be able to.

- **Weapon Tempo**; Stronger characters suffer less delay when recovering from heavy swings or wide arcs, giving more rhythm to great weapons.

> Example: A player wielding a greathammer with 35+ Strength may stagger a beast mid-charge, while a weaker player would be trampled or sent flying.

---

### Survival Interactions

Though primarily a combat stat, Strength plays a notable role in survival systems as well:

- **Fatigue Management**; While not as effective as Vitality, Strength allows characters to perform physical tasks—like climbing, swimming, or fighting—more efficiently, slightly reducing stamina usage and slowing the accumulation of **Fatigue**.

- **Environmental Resistance**;  Strength offers limited benefits against harsh terrain:
  
  - Breaking down barriers or smashing obstacles without tools
  
  - Forcing open jammed doors or vaults
  
  - Wading through deep snow, sludge, or mud with reduced penalties

> Example: A player navigating a wind-battered mountain pass may be able to **brute force** their way through a fallen gate rather than backtracking for a key.

---
### Actions to Raise Strength

In *Chronicle*, characters can increase their Strength attribute through various actions that reflect their physical prowess and combat experience. Below are key actions along with the associated bonuses they provide:

| Action Description                | Bonus Applied                                           |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Connecting with a Weapon**      | Increases familiarity with weapon handling, granting a +1 bonus to damage scaling for that weapon type. |
| **Training with an Instructor**   | Provides a +2 bonus to Strength for the next Attribute Check and unlocks new Strength-based skills or talents. |
| **Passing Attribute Checks**       | Successfully passing a Strength-related check raises Strength by 1, reflecting growth through practical experience. |
| **Using Strength-based Skills**    | Each successful use of a Strength-based skill grants a +1 bonus to Strength for the duration of the encounter, enhancing combat effectiveness. |

These actions encourage players to actively engage with the game mechanics and develop their characters' physical capabilities, reinforcing the importance of Strength in both combat and exploration.

---

### Raising Strength Permanently

In *Chronicle*, players can raise their Strength attribute permanently through a combination of experience points (XP) and specific milestones. The process is designed to reward players for engaging with the game mechanics and achieving significant accomplishments in their character's journey.

#### Experience Points (XP) System

1. **Gaining XP**: Players earn XP through various activities, including:
   
   - Completing quests and missions.
  
   - Defeating enemies and bosses.
  
   - Successfully passing Attribute Checks.

   - Engaging in combat and using Strength-based skills.

   - Participating in training sessions with instructors or mentors.

2. **XP Thresholds for Raising Strength**: To permanently increase Strength, players must accumulate a certain amount of XP. The following table outlines the XP thresholds required for each level of Strength from 1 to 40:

| Strength Level | XP Required to Raise Strength |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 to 2         | 50 XP                         |
| 2 to 3         | 100 XP                        |
| 3 to 4         | 150 XP                        |
| 4 to 5         | 200 XP                        |
| 5 to 6         | 300 XP                        |

| 9 to 10        | 700 XP                        |
| 10 to 11       | 800 XP                        |
| 11 to 12       | 900 XP                        |
| 12 to 13       | 1,000 XP                      |
| 13 to 14       | 1,200 XP                      |
| 14 to 15       | 1,400 XP                      |
| 15 to 16       | 1,600 XP                      |
| 16 to 17       | 1,800 XP                      |
| 17 to 18       | 2,000 XP                      |
| 18 to 19       | 2,200 XP                      |
| 19 to 20       | 2,500 XP                      |
| 20 to 21       | 2,800 XP                      |
| 21 to 22       | 3,100 XP                      |
| 22 to 23       | 3,400 XP                      |

| 24 to 25       | 4,200 XP                      |
| 25 to 26       | 4,600 XP                      |
| 26 to 27       | 5,000 XP                      |
| 27 to 28       | 5,500 XP                      |
| 28 to 29       | 6,000 XP                      |
| 29 to 30       | 6,500 XP                      |
| 30 to 31       | 7,000 XP                      |
| 31 to 32       | 7,500 XP                      |
| 32 to 33       | 8,000 XP                      |
| 33 to 34       | 8,500 XP                      |
| 34 to 35       | 9,000 XP                      |
| 35 to 36       | 9,500 XP                      |
| 36 to 37       | 10,000 XP                     |
| 37 to 38       | 10,500 XP                     |
| 38 to 39       | 11,000 XP                     |
| 39 to 40       | 12,000 XP                     |

3. **Soft Scaling Curves**: As characters progress, the XP required to raise Strength increases significantly, especially in the higher levels. This design reflects the growing challenge of enhancing physical capabilities, encouraging players to engage in a variety of activities to earn XP rather than relying solely on combat.

4. **Training and Specialization**: Players can also seek out specialized training sessions or unique quests that provide additional XP bonuses or allow for faster progression in Strength. These opportunities may be available through NPC instructors or hidden locations within the game world.

---
#### Summary

By engaging in combat, completing quests, and utilizing Strength-based skills, players can earn XP to permanently raise their Strength attribute. The structured XP system, along with increasing thresholds, ensures that character progression feels rewarding and meaningful throughout the journey in *Chronicle*.
### Strength in Summary

In *Chronicle*, Strength is more than raw power—it’s the **anchor of physical interaction** in both combat and the world. Whether you're battering down undead knights with a rusted greathammer, or hauling the bones of a god through blizzard-choked valleys, Strength allows characters to endure, break, and dominate through sheer will.
