<center>REACTION SPEED AND ADAPTABILITY</center> 

---

Reflexes represent a character’s **agility of [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Mind\|mind]] and body**, focusing on **dodge timing**, **critical strikes**, and quick reactions to incoming threats. Unlike [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] which governs overall precision and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Stealth\|Stealth]], Reflexes specifically determine **when** and **how** a character evades danger or lands a lethal hit at the perfect moment. High-REF characters take on a cat-like grace, capable of weaving through attacks and exploiting openings beyond typical physical limits.

## Damage & Scaling (Crit Mechanics)

### Critical Strike Formula

In *Chronicle*, **critical hits** factor in **Reflexes** plus the character’s **second highest attribute** (often **Dex** for nimble weapons, but could be **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]** or **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|Faith]]** for other builds). For instance:

`Crit Chance (%) = Base Weapon Crit + (REF ÷ 2) + (Second Highest Attribute ÷ 4)`

> *Example:* A bow with a base 5% crit chance. A character has 30 REF and 25 DEX.  
> - (30 ÷ 2) = +15%  
> - (25 ÷ 4) = +6.25%  
> So total Crit = 5% + 15% + ~6% = ~26%  

### Dodge & Parry Enhancements

While not a direct damage boost, Reflexes helps maximize the effectiveness of **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Finesse/Finesse\|Finesse]]-based maneuvers** that lead to critical strikes or safe windows for counterattacks. A successful dodge or parry often transitions into a near-instant critical opportunity against vulnerable foes.

## Equipment Thresholds & Interactions

Reflexes don’t usually *prevent* a character from wielding gear, but certain **light or medium armors** and **precision weapons** provide synergy with high Reflexes:

| Equipment Type       | Reflex Benefit                | Notes                                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Light Armor\|Light Armor]]          | +Dodge chance or easier dodge frames | Encourages agile evasion-based builds                     |
| [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Medium Armor\|Medium Armor]]         | Moderate synergy with STR + REF       | Balanced approach for partial tanking & partial mobility  |
| Nimble Weapons       | Often pair with DEX + REF for crit-based combos or rapid attacks |

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|Armor]] Weight Penalty**: Heavier armors hamper dodge frames, hindering Reflex-based defense. Light and medium sets grant a small **dodge bonus**, making them more conducive to leveling Reflexes effectively.

> *Example:* A leather chestpiece might offer a +3% dodge bonus if the player’s REF is above 15.

## Skills & Talents Affected

Reflex-based characters unlock or enhance a variety of **Evasion**, **Counterattack**, or **Precision** [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]]:

- **Enhanced Dodge** – Increases iframes (invincibility frames) during each dodge roll or sidestep. *(Requires 15 REF)*  

- **Backstep Counter** – Grants a damage bonus if striking immediately after a successful dodge. *(20 REF)*  

- **Deadly Timing** – Improves crit chance further if landing an attack within 0.5s after evading. *(25 REF)*  

- **Blade Dance** – Allows chaining multiple light weapon strikes for a stacking crit chance each successful blow. *(30 REF, synergy with Dex)*

Additionally, some advanced **Trap Disarm** or **Ambush** talents factor heavily into Reflexes, as they revolve around perfect timing or seizing an unexpected opening.

## 4. [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Combat\|Combat]] & Survival Interactions

### Dodge Windows & Reaction Speed

- **Extended Dodge Window:**  
  High Reflexes offer more forgiving timing for evasive maneuvers—where a low-REF character would be clipped, a high-REF character narrowly escapes.
  
- **Mitigating Lethal Blows:**  
  Reflex-based fighters rely on *not* getting hit rather than absorbing damage. That synergy with **light or medium armor** ensures minimal [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]] usage for swift movement.

- **Survival Through Avoidance:**  
  Reflexes also help circumvent environmental hazards—dodging rolling boulders, leaping off collapsing bridges, or sidestepping pitfalls. In random encounters or ambushes, quick reflexes can secure the first strike advantage or timely retreat.

### Leveling & Resource Management

- **[[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Dodging\|Dodging]] & Critical Attacks:**  
  Reflexes incrementally increases through successful dodges and landing critical hits with an appropriate weapon. Each moment of near-miss or precise strike refines the character’s reflexes further.
  
- **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|Fatigue]] & Recovery:**  
  While Reflexes doesn’t directly reduce Fatigue, well-timed dodges reduce wasted stamina in lengthy fights, indirectly conserving resources. Swiftly ending combats with critical strikes means less overall resource drain for healing or repairs.

## Summary

Reflexes revolve around **split-second timing**, **dodge mastery**, and **critical hits**. Characters who invest in REF become the elusive dancers of Velmoryth, weaving seamlessly through harm and striking with lethal precision. From defusing a cunning trap at the final moment to capitalizing on an enemy’s missed swing, Reflexes ensure agile survivors thrive by never letting danger fully land its blow.
