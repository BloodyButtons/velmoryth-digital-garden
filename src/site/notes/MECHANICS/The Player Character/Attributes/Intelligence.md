<center>TO MASTER YOURSELF AND YOUR FOES</center>

---

**Intelligence** reflects a character’s capacity for complex thought, arcane mastery, and meticulous understanding of Velmoryth’s hidden forces. Where [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] favor physical prowess, Intelligence focuses on **mental acuity** and **magical precision**. Characters with high INT can cast intricate spells, decipher eldritch lore, and unravel the secrets of cursed artifacts with ease.

## Spell Damage & Scaling

Intelligence primarily affects the **power**, **accuracy**, and **efficiency** of **arcane magic**. It has less impact on faith-based invocations, which rely on **Faith (FTH)**, but it still can assist in certain universal spell mechanics.

### Spell Damage & Efficiency

- **Damage Scaling:**  

  Arcane schools ([[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Destruction/Destruction\|Destruction]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Transmutation/Transmutation\|Transmutation]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Illusionism/Illusion\|Illusion]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Conjuring/Conjuration\|Conjuration]]) all draw from INT to determine their **damage** and **potency**. Higher INT yields stronger spells- bigger fireballs, more potent illusions, longer-lasting conjurations.
  
- **Mana Consumption:**  

  The higher your INT, the more efficient your casting. Characters with high Intelligence expend less mana per spell, enabling them to sustain bombardment or maintain multiple spell effects longer.

- **Spell Accuracy or Reliability:**  

  Many spells with ballistic or skill-based aiming benefit from INT. Characters with insufficient INT risk **spell misfires**, reduced range, or partial spell effects. With enough INT, illusions become nearly flawless, conjurations hold their shapes, and destructive spells land precisely.

> **Example:** A Fire Bolt with **C-tier INT scaling** might do +20–30% damage at moderate INT, whereas a higher-tier Fire Lance with **A-tier INT scaling** could gain up to +60% with advanced knowledge.

## Equipment Thresholds & Interaction

Arcane items require **Intelligence** to handle advanced magical constructs, from **wizard’s staves** and **enchanted orbs** to **rune-etched robes**:

| Equipment Type          | Typical INT Requirement | Notes                                               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Wizard Staff (Basic)    | 10-15 INT               | Basic arcane channel, moderate damage scaling       |
| Arcane Focus / Orb      | 15-25 INT               | Allows for advanced illusions, conjurations, etc.   |
| Enchanted Robes         | 10-25 INT               | Low protection but strong mana regen or spell buffs |
| Spell Tomes / Grimoires | 20-30 INT               | Required for learning advanced or rare spells       |

1. **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Item Level\|Item Level]]**: As gear’s IL increases, so do the **INT bonuses**. A high-IL staff might double or triple certain spell effects or drastically reduce mana costs.

2. **Misuse Consequences**: Equipping arcane gear above one’s INT threshold can cause **unstable spell discharge**, **failed casts**, or increased **mana drain**, reflecting the caster’s struggle to control energies beyond their comprehension.

## Talents or Skills Affected

**Intelligence** is crucial for **Arcane** (non-[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|Faith]]) spellcasting classes and advanced magical talents:

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Destruction/Destruction\|Destruction]]**: Fire, frost, lightning, or other elemental blasts scale heavily from INT.

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Illusionism/Illusion\|Illusion]]**: Spell effectiveness (duration, radius) grows with INT, reducing chances of illusions breaking early.

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Conjuring/Conjuration\|Conjuration]]**: Summoned creatures gain greater [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|Health]] or power if the summoner’s INT is high enough.

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Transmutation/Transmutation\|Transmutation]]**: Complex transformations like turning enemies to stone or altering material demand significant INT thresholds.

**Skill & Talent Unlocks** might include:

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Intelligence Talents/Arcane Study\|Arcane Study]]**; Increases damage or range for elemental spells.  

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Intelligence Talents/Ritual Mastery\|Ritual Mastery]]**; Allows multi-layered spells requiring sustained concentration.  

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Intelligence Talents/Portal Theory\|Portal Theory]]**;  Grants limited teleportation or dimension-warping capabilities, but requires high INT.  

**Dialogue & Investigation**:  

- INT can reveal **hidden knowledge** or let you pick up on subtle clues in arcane interactions, and help detect **lies** or illusions in specialized dialogues (though [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Mind\|Mind]] also plays a role in resilience against illusions).

## Combat & Survival Interactions

Despite being primarily an arcane attribute, Intelligence offers:

1. **Combat Strategy & Spell Variety**  
   - High INT expands spell repertoire+ crowd control, direct damage, illusions, or support.  
  
   - In a group setting, an intelligent caster can adapt to different scenarios like illusions to distract enemies or conjuring allies in tough fights.

2. **Exploration & Lore**  
   
   - **Rune Deciphering**: Complex puzzles or glyph wards blocking paths can be bypassed with INT-based skill checks.  
   
   - **Arcane Cartography**: Scrying or scanning spells might require a certain INT threshold to glean hidden routes, illusions, or dimension rifts.

3. **Resource Management**  
   
   - Through improved **spell efficiency**, INT lowers [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Mana\|Mana]] cost. Characters can rely more on spells for survival tactics like conjuring light sources, purifying water, or diagnosing curses.

4. **Dialogue & Investigation**  
   
   - Intelligent characters can piece together **lore fragments**, noticing contradictory statements or subtle hints. They may uncover infiltration attempts or demon possessions hidden behind carefully chosen words. (Paired with Mind to resist illusions or memory attacks.)

### Summary

Intelligence in *Chronicle* is the **cornerstone** of magical might and arcane problem-solving. By hitting INT thresholds, players unlock devastating spells, reduce mana overhead, and excel at analyzing the hidden or esoteric corners of Velmoryth. Whether scorching hordes with raw destructive energy or weaving illusions to outwit foes, high-INT characters command the battlefield and shape the environment around them through insight and skillful casting.
