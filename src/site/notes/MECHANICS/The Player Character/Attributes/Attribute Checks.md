<center>TO TEST YOURSELF, AND YOUR RESOLVE </center>

---

In *Chronicle*, **Attribute Checks** occur whenever a character attempts an action that tests the limits of their physical, mental, or mystical capacities. These checks are not arbitrary dice rolls- rather, they reflect **your character’s real, hard-earned progress** in a given attribute. Below, you’ll find examples of how each attribute might be tested in-game, along with a sample table illustrating typical difficulty thresholds and how attributes apply to them. Performing an Attribute Check successfully will raise the related attribute by 1, ***BUT ONLY ONE TIME***. 

---

## How Attribute Checks Work

When an Attribute Check is required, the game compares your **current attribute score** (plus any relevant skill, talent, or environmental modifiers) to a **Difficulty Threshold (DT)** set by the situation. If your adjusted score **meets or exceeds** this threshold, you succeed. If not, you fail or achieve only partial results.

### Example Difficulty Table

| Difficulty | Attribute Score Needed | Description / Example                                            |
|------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy (DT 5)   | ~5–10                 | Routine tasks; prying a loose board, recognizing basic runes.     |
| Medium (DT 10) | ~10–15                | Average feats; crossing a narrow ledge, lifting a hefty crate.     |
| Hard (DT 15)  | ~15–20                | Demanding tasks; smashing a locked door, resisting a potent [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Poison\|poison]].|
| Extreme (DT 20)| ~20–25                | Impressive achievements; hoisting portcullis, illusions clarity.   |
| Legendary (DT 25+)| 25+               | Near-mythic; withstanding a tornado blast, unraveling an ancient crypt’s final wards. |

> **Note**: The actual attribute range needed will vary by synergy (e.g., relevant [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]] or situational bonuses/penalties).

## Summary

Attribute Checks translate your character’s **lived experience** into tangible tests throughout *Chronicle*. Whether you’re muscling through a barricade, unveiling arcane secrets, or surviving a mind-shredding confrontation, each attribute check is a **narrative-driver** that merges roleplaying with mechanical depth. The more you’ve honed an attribute, the greater your odds of **breaking free from Velmoryth’s harsh constraints** and seizing triumph in the face of adversity.
