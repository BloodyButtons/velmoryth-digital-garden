<center>THE MEASURE OF YOUR METTLE </center>

---

Attributes govern the **core capabilities** of a character in *Chronicle*. They define what a character is *capable* of doing, what they are *proficient* at, and how they interact with the world of **Velmoryth** both narratively and mechanically. Unlike traditional RPGs, attributes in *Chronicle* are not raised through a level-up screen, but through **active use** and **practical experience**. If you swing a sword, you grow stronger. If you cast spells, your magical understanding deepens. If you brave the wilds in heavy armor, your vitality will harden.

This system reflects the game’s central philosophy of **immersive progression** as skills and power are earned through hardship, not granted through arbitrary points. Attributes are also used in **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Attribute Checks\|Attribute Checks]]**, which gate certain dialogue options, environmental interactions, or skill requirements.

## Final Thoughts

Each attribute is tied directly to the skills, gear, and playstyle of the character. You don’t choose what kind of character you want to be in a menu, you **become** that character through **what you do**, what you carry, and how you survive. You are a reflection of the journey, etched into your character through action.
