<center>FORTITUDE OF THE PSYCHE 
</center>

---

**Mind** represents a character’s **mental fortitude**, **spiritual resilience**, and **capacity** to wield or resist certain types of magical energies. While **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]]** governs how well a character *casts* spells, Mind governs **how much** they can **store**, **sustain**, or **withstand**- including memorizing multiple spells and enduring mental assaults. Characters with high Mind resist the insidious corruptions of Velmoryth’s horrors and maintain stable spell slots to deploy arcane or psionic powers.

## Damage & Scaling

Mind does not directly increase physical or magical damage, but it provides **resistance scaling** against specific magical damage types and mental status ailments. When combined with Intelligence or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Faith\|Faith]], it creates a robust caster or a more resilient disciple of the arcane/holy arts.

### Magical Resistance Table

Below is a generalized Mind-based resistance scaling for each magical damage type. The percentages represent how much damage is reduced (or how quickly a status effect from that damage dissipates):

| Mind Range | Arcane Resist | Unholy Resist | Fire Resist | Frost Resist | Lightning Resist |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 1–10       | +0%-5%        | +0%-5%        | +0%–5%      | +0%–5%       | +0%–5%           |
| 11–20      | +5%-10%       | +5%-10%       | +5%–10%     | +5%–10%      | +5%–10%          |
| 21–30      | +10%-15%      | +10%-**15**%  | +10%–15%    | +10%–15%     | +10%–15%         |
| 31–40      | +15%-20%      | +15%-20%      | +15%–20%    | +15%–20%     | +15%–20%         |
| 41–50      | +20%-25%      | +20%-25%      | +20%–25%    | +20%–25%     | +20%–25%         |
| 51+        | +25%-30%      | +25%-30%      | +25%–30%    | +25%–30%     | +25%–30%         |

> *Note:* The **exact** resist values within these ranges can be influenced by gear, [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]], and special enchantments. Higher Mind *also* reduces the severity/duration of mental or magical afflictions.

## Equipment Thresholds & Interactions

### Mind-Oriented Items

Certain **arcane gear** such as psionic focuses, **Memory Tomes**, or **Ward [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Accessories/Amulets\|Amulets]]** demand a minimum Mind threshold, reflecting the need for stable mental scaffolding:

| Equipment Type         | Mind Requirement | Notes                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Psionic Focus**      | 15-25 MIN        | Enhances mental-based spells or illusions, stable mind needed    |
| **Ward Amulet**        | 20-30 MIN        | Improves resistances against curses, illusions, or mental blasts |
| **Dreamcatcher Staff** | 25-35 MIN        | Allows forging illusions or storing multiple spell illusions     |
| **Memory Tomes**       | 15-40 MIN        | Increases or organizes spells memorized when MIND is high enough |

Attempting to use these items below the required Mind results in **unstable wards**, **fragmented illusions**, or even self-inflicted psychic backlash.

### Spell Memory Table

In addition to magical resistance, Mind determines how many spells a character can hold in active memory:

| Mind Score | Spells Memorized | Example Feat                                                     |
|------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–10       | 1                | Basic cantrip or minor spell slot                                |
| 11–20      | 2                | Capable of toggling between simpler illusions or curses          |
| 21–30      | 3                | Comfortably juggles multiple mid-tier spells                     |
| 31–40      | 4                | Handles high-level conjurations alongside utility or illusions   |
| 41–50      | 5                | Casts advanced spells simultaneously (e.g., wards + illusions)   |
| 51+        | 6+               | Near-legendary mental discipline, sustaining complex multi-layers|

> *Note:* Additional talents or specialized gear (like **Memory Tomes**) might let players exceed these baseline memory slots.

## Skills & Talents Affected

### Psionic / Mind-Focused Abilities

**Mind** opens the door for psionic skill trees like **telepathy**, **mind control**, and **psychic illusions**that rely on mental discipline over raw intelligence:

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Mind Talents/Telepathic Overlook\|Telepathic Overlook]]:** Scry the landscape around you in a 100m radius. *(Requires 15 MIN)*

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Psionic/Psionic Crush\|Psionic Crush]]:** Concentrated mental assault that inflicts heavy [[MECHANICS/Combat/Components/Posture\|posture]] or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|health]] drain, ignoring traditional [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]]. *(25 MIN)*

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Mind Talents/Mental Fortress\|Mental Fortress]]:** Passive talent boosting magical resistance, synergy with high Mind builds. *(Requires 20 MIN)*

### [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Defensive/Defensive\|Defensive]] or Resist-Based Talents

Characters with high Mind can learn talents that fortify them against Weeping, Terror, or Madness. These talents tie in with Mind’s role as an internal bastion of will:

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Mind Talents/Calm the Whispers\|Calm the Whispers]]**; Reduces mental corruption from cursed artifacts. *(Requires 20 MIN)*

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Enchanting/Arcane Ward\|Arcane Ward]]**; Enhances existing resistances from gear, primarily for Fire, Frost, Lightning, or Unholy. *(Requires 25 MIN)*

### Memory Enrichment

Mind-based skills also let you optimize or reorganize memorized spells efficiently:

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Mind Talents/Mnemonic Mastery\|Mnemonic Mastery]]**: Gain 1 additional memorized spell slot. *(Requires 30 MIN)*

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Mind Talents/Ritual Overload\|Ritual Overload]]**: Temporarily exceed your normal memory capacity at the cost of extra [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]]. *(Requires 35 MIN)*

## Combat & Survival Interactions

### Combat

1. **Resistance & Defense**  
   
   - High Mind soaks up magical damage from enemy spells or enchanted attacks, mitigating arcane blasts, unholy curses, or elemental strikes.
   
   - Psychic or fear-based attacks find less purchase—leading to shorter, weaker status effects.

2. **Spell Memory & Versatility**  
   
   - Having multiple spells memorized means the character can adapt mid-combat, switching from illusions to direct offense or healing support if they also have Faith or Intelligence synergy.

3. **Psionic Offense**  
   
   - Mind-based talents allow targeted mental attacks—**telekinetic pushes**, **mental stuns**, or illusions that distract foes—giving unique crowd control or layered synergy with allies.

### Survival

1. **Status Effects**  
   
   - Mind resists certain mental afflictions like **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/The Weeping\|The Weeping]]**, **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Terror\|Terror]]**, **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Status Effects/Madness\|Madness]]**, or illusions that lurk in cursed ruins or the lairs of eldritch entities.

2. **Enchanted Environments**  
   
   - High Mind helps you withstand oppressive magical auras in corrupted zones, enduring mental strains or illusions that cause lesser explorers to retreat.

3. **Resource Management**  
  
   - While Mind does not directly affect [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Hunger\|hunger]] or [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Thirst\|thirst]], it can reduce the mental strain from reading complex tomes or performing extended rituals—less likely to accumulate fatigue from magical tasks.

## Summary

**Mind** stands as the bedrock of **mental resilience** in *Chronicle*, anchoring a character’s ability to store spells, endure horrifying illusions, and channel psionic or advanced arcane abilities. Through higher Mind thresholds, players gain additional memorized spells, heightened magical resistances, and the potential for reality-bending psionic powers. Whether confronting terrors in ancient crypts or weaving illusions around unsuspecting foes, a strong Mind ensures you remain steadfast in the face of Velmoryth’s psychic onslaughts.
