<center>TO ENDURE, OR TO PERISH</center>

---

**Vitality** embodies a character’s physical robustness, resistance to harm, and ability to sustain prolonged exertion. It governs **overall [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Health\|health]]**, **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Stamina\|stamina]]**, **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Fatigue\|fatigue]]** management, and **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/General Stats/Encumbrance\|encumbrance]] capacity**- essentials for those who endure the harshest demands of Velmoryth’s [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Combat\|combat]] and survival challenges. High Vitality ensures you can persist through draining fights, carry heavy gear, and withstand deadly blows far beyond an ordinary adventurer.

## Detailed Mechanical Effects 

### Health Pool & Physical Resistance

- **Health Pool Increase:**  

  Each point of Vitality raises your maximum health, reflecting a character’s ability to absorb and recover from [[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Injuries\|injuries]].  

- **Physical Resistance:**  

  Vitality also reduces incoming **physical damage** or alleviates certain status effects (e.g., bleeds, bruises). The effect isn’t as direct as wearing [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Armor\|armor]], but it stacks with gear-based defenses for cumulative resilience.

### Stamina & Fatigue

- **Stamina Capacity:**  

  Vitality contributes significantly to a character’s stamina pool, the resource used to attack, block, sprint, and dodge. High Vitality means you can fight or run for longer before running out of breath.  

- **Fatigue Management:**  

  Vitality slows the rate at which fatigue accumulates (especially in harsh conditions). Characters with robust constitutions can endure difficult journeys, extreme climates, or lengthy battles without succumbing to exhaustion.

### Endurance Against Hunger/Thirst

- **Extended Survival:**  

  Vitality allows you to go slightly longer without food or water. While it doesn’t nullify hunger or thirst, it buys precious time before negative status effects set in.  

- **Toughness in Bad Environments:**  

  Higher VIT reduces the penalties from environmental stressors (e.g., extreme cold or heat), tying into your ability to withstand brutal conditions.

## Equipment Thresholds & Interactions

Vitality is not a *hard requirement* for most weapons, but it’s critical for **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Armor/Heavy Armor\|heavy armor]]** and certain shields, including **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Tower Shields\|tower shields]]** or extremely bulky suits of plate. 

| Equipment Type           | VIT Requirement | Notes                                                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Heavy Plate Armor        | 20–30 VIT       | Reduces stamina drain, prevents “overburden” state                         |
| Reinforced Tower Shield  | 25–35 VIT       | Prevents staggering under massive impacts (in addition to STR for usage)   |
| Full Plate & Extras      | 30+ VIT         | Suits combining multiple heavy pieces require higher Vitality to handle weight |

- **Encumbrance Capacity:**  

  High Vitality boosts how much you can carry before incurring penalties to movement and stamina usage. This includes heavy weapon sets, extensive supplies, or specialized siege gear.

- **Damage Mitigation:**  

  Some advanced sets of armor scale partially with Vitality to reduce incoming blunt damage or lessen the effect of bleeds and bruises—reflecting your body’s capacity to absorb hits.

## [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Skills And Talents\|Skills and Talents]] Affected

Vitality unlocks a range of **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Defensive/Defensive\|Defensive]]**, **Defiance**, or **Endurance** [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Talents\|talents]], focusing on surviving lethal hits, resisting status ailments, and sustaining stamina in prolonged fights. Examples include:

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Vitality Talents/Iron Body\|Iron Body]]**; Reduces the severity of status ailments (like bleeds or fractures). *(Requires 20 VIT)*

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Vitality Talents/Enduring Heart\|Enduring Heart]]**; Slows down hunger and thirst drain while traveling. *(Requires 15 VIT)*

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Vitality Talents/Bulwark Stance\|Bulwark Stance]]**; Improves block stability with tower [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Equipment/Shields/Shields\|shields]] or heavy armor, halving stamina cost under certain thresholds. *(Requires 25 VIT)*

- **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Talents/Vitality Talents/Steadfast\|Steadfast]]**; Increases your chance to resist forced movement or knockdown effects. *(Requires 30 VIT)*

These talents synergize particularly well with Strength-based frontline warriors, but also benefit any character seeking more endurance in the face of Velmoryth’s hazards.

## Combat and Survival Interactions

### Combat

1. **Increased Survivability**  
   
   - Large health pool and damage mitigation let you trade hits, weather group encounters, and stand in the front line without succumbing quickly.

2. **Sustained Offensive**  
  
   - Higher stamina capacity allows for longer combo chains, heavier blocks, and fewer forced retreats. Characters with limited Vitality risk running out of steam in drawn-out battles.

3. **Resistance to Physical Status Effects**  

   - Bruises, minor bleeds, and sprains dissipate more quickly or trigger less frequently under a robust Vitality build.

### Survival

1. **Carrying Supplies**  
  
   - Vitality-based characters comfortably haul extra rations, bedrolls, or heavy tools, essential in multi-day expeditions or deep dungeon crawls.

1. **Extended Resilience**  
  
   - In emergencies (injuries, environmental threats), high Vitality keeps the character stable longer, offering more time to find safe shelter or medical supplies.

1. **Combat Recovery**  
   
   - Taking hits gradually improves Vitality—players forging their path through harsh lands learn to adapt physically, turning damage sustained into incremental progress.

## Summary

Vitality in *Chronicle* is the cornerstone of **physical resilience**. Characters who prioritize it can soak up damage, stave off hunger and thirst a bit longer, lug heavy equipment, and thrive in punishing environments. While [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] might break enemies swiftly and [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] might evade danger, Vitality simply **endures**, standing unbowed against the might of Velmoryth’s cruelties.
