<center>“To find your path, you must first survive the journey.”</center>

In CHRONICLE, exploration and survival are not separate mechanics, they are the same heartbeat. To explore is to endanger yourself. To survive is to carve a path through the unknown. Every landmark found, every dungeon unearthed, every tale of gods and ruin begins with a single step into the wild.

This is not a world built for the player. It is a world that exists regardless of their presence. It does not ask for your participation, it dares you to endure it.

# Core Philosophy 

Exploratory Survival is the essence of the journey. It is the intersection of risk and reward. The longer you travel, the harsher the world becomes—and the greater the discoveries. This is not fast-travel convenience or checklist completion. This is earned knowledge, the kind you bleed for.

The player does not miraculously discover the map in some abstract menu. They chart paths, navigate to landmarks, and record their findings. Then, and only then, can they create a map. There are no quest markers. Players must navigate the old way. They must pay attention to dialogues, environmental cues, pieces of lore, and the like.

# Defining Systems

### Player-Driven Navigation

There are no glowing trails. No automaps. The world must be learned like a real place.

- Landmark Navigation 

 >Players guide themselves by rivers, mountain ridges, broken towers, and sun movement.

- Manual Mapmaking  

> Players discover fragments, draw their own maps, or rely on word-of-mouth and local rumors.

- In-World Tools 

> Compasses, sextants, and star-charts help only if you know how to use them. At certain points players may even use their footprints to retrace their steps.

Getting lost is not failure. It is part of the journey. 

### Long-Form Expeditions

 Journeys are planned, not casual strolls. Preparation is as important as execution. Pack light, pack smart.  Choose between rations, gear, torches, or tools. Encumbrance matters. Camp often. Nightfall brings frost, predators, and worse. 

Expedition journals may be used by the player to manually annotate routes, finds, and dangers.

> *"North-Northwest of the Broken Sepulcher lies a cave nestled on the treeline.*

### A Harsh, Dynamic World

The environment is alive and it doesn’t care if you live.

- Weather Effects 

> Blizzards obscure paths and extinguish torches. Miasmic fogs corrupt and confuse. Rain erases footprints and trails.

- Biome-Specific Threats  

> The Cradle of Rust eats flesh with iron spores. The Hollow Marches drain hope as much as blood.

- Day/Night Cycle

> Some areas are only accessible or visible at specific times. Travel by night is possible—but rarely wise.

### Layered Discovery

Exploration is not just about reaching a location, it’s about understanding it.

Secret Dungeons & Hidden Paths can be Found through terrain cues, forgotten journals, or sheer curiosity. Engaging with the world rewards the player deeply. The more they can understand and immerse themselves within the world, the more that they can discover and the easier things will be for them.

To explore, the player must survive. And to survive, they must explore.

Food, water, and warmth are limited, pushing forward without preparation can mean death.

Diseases, wounds, and exhaustion accumulate. Healing is rare. Risk is constant.

This isn’t exploration as a choice. It’s exploration as necessity. You must venture forth to grow stronger, to find hidden powers, to make meaning in a world that offers no guidance.

> *“The world is vast. The world is cruel. And still—some choose to walk it.*”
