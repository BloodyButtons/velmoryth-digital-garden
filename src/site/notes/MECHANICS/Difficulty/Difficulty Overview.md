<center>THE MEASURE OF YOUR STRENGTH</center> 

---

In CHRONICLE, difficulty is not a setting, it’s an evolving force. The world grows more dangerous the longer you survive and the stronger you become. This is governed by the hidden [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]]. This is a system that increases over time and in response to your character’s unseen growth. As your [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Skills And Talents\|Skills And Talents]] sharpen and your equipment improves, so too does the hostility of the world around you. Enemies grow stronger, rare variants emerge, and the landscape itself may shift against you.

This system preserves tension throughout the game, ensuring that no matter how powerful you become, the world remains a threat. There are no level-scaled enemies or artificial balancing, only a world that responds. Combined with CHRONICLE’s focus on [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Exploratory Survival\|Exploratory Survival]] and [[MECHANICS/The Core Pillars/Immersion\|Immersion]], difficulty becomes part of the narrative. You are not progressing through the world. You are provoking it.
