## Item Level

In *Chronicle*, **Item Level (IL)** is the hidden statistic that measures your character’s overall gear quality. It governs two core functions:

1. **Contributing to  [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Character Level\|Character Level]]** (alongside [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Skill Level\|Skill Level]] and [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Talent Level\|Talent Level]].

2. **Determining the loot quality** you’re likely to find or craft.

### Equipment Slots
Your character has **14 total slots**, each capable of holding one piece of equipment:

1. Head  
2. Shoulders  
3. Chest & Arms  
4. Waist  
5. Gloves  
6. Legs  
7. Boots  
8. Ring  
9. Amulet  
10. Quiver  
11. Cape  
12. Left Hand  
13. Right Hand  
14. Ring

### Calculating Item Level
- **Per-Item Value**: Each item in a slot contributes its own numerical value (e.g., 1, 12, 27) to your total IL.  

- **Summation & Rounding**: The sum of all slot values is then **rounded to the nearest multiple of 10** to derive your actual **Item Level**.  
 
  - *Example*: If each slot has value **1**, that sums to **13**. Rounded to the nearest multiple of 10, the IL becomes **10**.

### Dynamic Loot & Outliers
Your **Item Level** influences the loot you find through [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]]:

- **Typical Drops**: The system spawns gear around your IL, occasionally slightly below or above.  

- **Outlier Items**: There is always a small percentage chance to find a piece significantly stronger (or weaker), pushing you toward the next threshold or rewarding you with an unexpected upgrade.

### Maximum Item Level

- The total **Item Level** from all 13 slots is capped at **500**. Even with top-tier gear across every slot, you can never exceed this limit.  

**In short, Item Level is an evolving measure of a character’s gear power, essential for informing Character Level and dynamically influencing the rewards the world offers you.**
