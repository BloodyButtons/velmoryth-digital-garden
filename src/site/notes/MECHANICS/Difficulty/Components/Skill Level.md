## Skill Level

**Skill Level (SL)** reflects your character’s learned abilities across various **skill classes**- combat techniques, magic, crafting, and beyond. It is capped at **250** points total. Alongside [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Item Level\|Item Level]] and [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Talent Level\|Talent Level]], this is one of the major components of [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Character Level\|Character Level]].

### Point Values per Skill

- Each **base skill** is worth **20 points**, regardless of its tier.
- Mastering higher tiers of a base skill still costs the same **20 points**, but yields greater in-game benefits.
- You may mix and match skills from different classes at any time, so long as you stay within the **250-point cap**.

### Maximum Skill Threshold

- When you enable enough skills to reach **240 points** (12 base skills), you gain an additional **+10 points**, pushing your total SL to **250**.

- This **spike** can substantially increase **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]]** difficulty, so consider carefully whether to fully load up on all possible skills or focus your efforts on a select few.

### Enabling & Disabling Skills

- You can **disable** or **reallocate** skills at **Rest Locations** or **with Instructors**, allowing you to adapt your skillset to new challenges.

- Disabling high-tier or niche skills can lower your SL, easing **World Level** pressure but also reducing your combat and utility options.

**In essence, Skill Level is a flexible measure of your character’s chosen specializations. While you can cap out at 250 points for a sizeable power boost, it also means the world grows that much more dangerous in response.**
