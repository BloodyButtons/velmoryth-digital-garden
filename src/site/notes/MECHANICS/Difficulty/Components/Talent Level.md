## Talent Level

**Talent Level (TL)** represents specialized, more potent abilities that amplify your character’s playstyle. Like **[[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Skills And Talents\|Skills]]**, Talents can be freely enabled, disabled, or swapped at **[[MECHANICS/Survival/Components/Rest Locations\|Rest Locations]]** or with **Instructors**.

### Talent Point Values

- Each **Talent** is worth **40 points** toward your Talent Level.
- The maximum possible **Talent Level** is **240** plus an extra **+10** if you enable all available Talents (for a total of **250**).

### Prerequisite Skills

- Each Talent requires a certain number of base Skills in a related **skill class** (e.g., [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Martial/Martial\|Martial]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Finesse/Finesse\|Finesse]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Physical Skills/Versatility/Versatility\|Versatility]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Destruction/Destruction\|Destruction]], [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Enchanting/Enchanting\|Enchanting]], or [[MECHANICS/The Player Character/Skills and Talents/Magic/Magical Skills/Invocation/Invocation\|Invocation]] skills).

- The exact requirement varies by Talent, ensuring only characters truly specialized in a field can unlock its associated Talent.

### Risk vs. Reward
- Like Skills, **activating more Talents** raises your **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Character Level\|Character Level]]** and by extension, **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]]**-making enemies stronger.
- Choosing which Talents to disable or enable at any given time is a key **strategic decision**, balancing power against escalating difficulty.

**In short, Talent Level is a measure of advanced prowess expanding your capabilities significantly, but also increasing the danger your character will face in Velmoryth.**
