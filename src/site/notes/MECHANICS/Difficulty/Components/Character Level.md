*Character Level* is the totaled sum of **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Skill Level\|Skill Level]], [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Talent Level\|Talent Level]], and [[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/Item Level\|Item Level]].** This total is added to the time variable which calculates **[[MECHANICS/Difficulty/Components/World Level\|World Level]].** ***Character Level is a bit of a misleading term. Think of it as more "Character Points". Players can have a maximum character level of 1000. 250 SL, 250 TL, and 500 IL.*** ## Character Level (CL)

**Character Level** in *Chronicle* is not a classic RPG “level up” system. Instead, it acts more like a pool of **character points** gained from three areas:

1. **Skill Level (SL)**  
   - Tracks mastery over combat techniques, magic, and other learned abilities.  
   - Max: **250 points**

2. **Talent Level (TL)**  
   - Represents passive traits, specialized proficiencies, or unique racial/heritage bonuses.  
   - Max: **250 points**

3. **Item Level (IL)**  
   - Reflects the combined “power” of all equipped gear.  
   - Max: **500 points**

When you sum these three values- SL + TL + IL, you get your **Character Level**, capped at **1000** total points.

### Why "Character Level" is a Misnomer
Rather than a linear XP bar, CL is more akin to a dynamic “power index.” You can freely invest in (or acquire) skills, talents, and items at any time, and watch your CL climb. There’s no single path to “level up”, just various ways to accumulate points toward your overall potential.

### Connection to World Level
Your final **Character Level** is then added to a **time-based variable** (representing the gradual escalation of threats in the world) to compute **World Level**. The stronger you become and the more time that passes, the more dangerous Velmoryth grows in response. This ensures a perpetually challenging experience, while also rewarding those who hone their skills, talents, and gear thoughtfully.
