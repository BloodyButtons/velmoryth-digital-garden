![WRAITH_PORTRAOT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/WRAITH_PORTRAOT.jpg)

They are the scream behind silence. The blur behind the veil of your waking thought. You do not see a Shatterwraith. You remember having seen one, a moment too late, a breath too slow- by then, you are already unraveling.

Of all [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/The Harrow\|The Harrow]] that [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]] has cast upon Velmoryth, it is the Shatterwraiths that most terrify even the mad. For they do not torment, nor do they chase. They do not strike, nor call, nor tear.

They erase.

There is no true form to a Shatterwraith. It is not a thing that was shaped, it is a mutable thing, formless save for the one it takes when observed by another. Witness accounts vary, often incoherent, frequently contradictory. Some speak of a tall figure whose joints float disconnected, limbs trailing behind it like kites. Others whisper of faces turned inside out, voices speaking not backwards but in reverse intention, each word eroding meaning rather than forming it.

Some report seeing themselves or versions of loved ones long dead, only to have their memories of them shredded moments later. One thing remains consistent: those who behold a Shatterwraith cannot accurately recall what they saw. Their words stutter, bleed, or repeat. Some cannot finish sentences at all.

In some cases, the Shatterwraith appears as absence. A gap in a procession. A chair at a table that no one sits in, but no one dares to fill. A darkness upon a sunlit field.And should one look too long at the absence, they, too, are forgotten.

The Wraith does not touch you—not in flesh. It touches your thread, your tether to reality. One by one, the things that made you you fall away. Your name becomes foreign. Your footsteps unfamiliar. You forget the color of your mother’s eyes. You forget what your hands feel like.

In time, others forget you as well.

It is said that those touched by a Shatterwraith vanish in plain sight, mid-conversation, mid-breath, mid-battle. The world around them carries on, their absence seamlessly unnoted. Even companions who fought at their side moments before cannot recall their presence, save for a faint headache, or an uneasy sense that something once was and is no longer.

A shattered thought. A thought that cannot be put back.

Little can be done once a Shatterwraith marks a soul. [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] have crafted Sigils of Recollection, runes inked into the flesh with blood and memory-thread, meant to anchor one’s being for a time. [[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]] recite oaths of identity before sleep—rituals carved into their armor or spoken through cracked vox-sigils that ring with a fading echo.

[[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]] do not resist. They simply sing the names of the fallen, over and over, so that the world does not forget them too.

And yet, even these defenses fail. The names dissolve. The sigils bleed dry. The oaths crumble.

Because the Wraiths are not death. They are non-being.

There are signs one must heed:

A shadow without a source.

A phrase you’ve never heard, spoken by a mouth that isn’t yours.

A memory you recall for the first time.

A companion you swore you’ve always known whose name you suddenly cannot place.

A conversation ending before it began.

A child crying for a sibling that never was.


When you feel these things… run. Or write your name on something that will last. Or scream it to the sky, so that some godless thing might remember it for you.

For to be touched by a Shatterwraith is not to die.

It is to be unmade, until the world has no record that you ever drew breath.
