I do not know how long I have walked now. Time moves strange out here, too quiet, like the world is holding its breath. The land bleeds at the edges of sense, mirrors turn to water, the air thickens with unseen weight, and I no longer trust the shape of my own shadow. I came here to map the Choir’s reach. To chart what they leave behind.

Instead, I found the Harrow.

No scholar taught me of them. No scripture names them. They do not belong in the tales of gods or devils. They are what comes after- after the gods died, after the Veil frayed, after hubris cracked the bones of creation. The Harrow are the echoes made flesh, the nightmares birthed from the wounds left by divinity’s fall. I believe they did not exist before [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]]. But now, they are spreading, like mold in a locked tomb.

They are not a species, or even a kind. They are… consequences. Manifestations of [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]]’s will, or perhaps merely its effects. I cannot say if the Choir commands them, or if they are just the detritus of its presence, the way blood pools from an open wound. But I have seen them. I have felt them.

The [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/Mawlights\|Mawlights]], floating and blind and terrible. They don’t move like anything in the world should, and their brilliance is not light but insight—forced, blistering insight. Men who see them die screaming, or worse, live babbling verses no one should ever know.

The [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/Mirror-Dwellers\|Mirror-Dwellers]], lurking behind reflections, waiting for acknowledgment like a sickness waits for a wound. I shattered every reflective surface I owned. I even gouged out the polished emblem on my compass. But sometimes, I still see my reflection blink just too slow.

And then the [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/Shatterwraiths\|Shatterwraiths]]. I cannot begin to describe them—not fully. Some are tall, others wide, all impossible. I passed one on the road once: a woman whose eyes ran like wax down her cheeks, and whose voice made my tongue twist in my mouth. I tried to record her. When I looked at my notes later, they were blank. And now… I’m not sure if she was ever there. Or if I was.

Worst of all are the [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/Beasts Of Suffering\|Beasts Of Suffering]]. These I understand. These I recognize. They are what remains when the song takes a human soul and plays it wrong. They are rage and grief given teeth. I watched one tear through three armored men with its bare hands, then collapse in silence, its form melting like wax beside a dying candle. When I approached, its face looked like mine.

The Harrow are not creatures. They are a condition. A symptom of a world unraveling. They appear where the Choir’s song is loudest, yes- but they also breed in silence, in places long abandoned, or even in the minds of those who dare to ask what truth lies beneath the world.

[[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] claim they can stop it. That there is still an art to hold the weave of reality in place. But even they are thinning, I think. Their spells flicker like torchlight in a gale. Their eyes don’t meet yours for long anymore.

If this is what comes after the gods, if the Harrow are the price of stealing power once locked away, then we were fools to ever desire it. Fools to believe the world would tolerate our rule.

They are not the end. No, there is still too much suffering for that. The Harrow are what comes before the end. They soften the earth. They hollow us out.

And when the last name is forgotten, when the last soul forgets even itself, I believe the Choir will sing one final note.

And then there will be the void, the infinite black expanse. 

Then, there will be silence.
