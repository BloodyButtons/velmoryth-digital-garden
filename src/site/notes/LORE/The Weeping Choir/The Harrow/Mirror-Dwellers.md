They call them Mirror-Dwellers, but that name does little to contain the horror. It suggests something hidden behind a pane of glass, watching. That would be comforting. That would be simple.

But the truth is far worse.

These beings do not live in reflections, they become them. They are not behind the mirror. **They are the mirror**. They wear your face like a mask of polished water, mimic your movement half a breath too slow, just long enough to be noticed. They are not interested in flesh, or blood, or even death. They seek only one thing:

Replacement.

It begins subtly. Your reflection smiles when you don’t. A gesture lingers too long. Your twin hand in the water reaches out before yours moves at all. The wisest response is to cover the mirror, shatter the surface, never look again. But few heed the signs. Curiosity is a crueler killer than hunger.

And when the final exchange comes, there is no thunderous rupture. No crackling magic or shattering scream. One moment, you are looking into a mirror. The next, you are no longer the one looking back.

From that point on, you are the reflection—trapped, screaming behind a pane of false glass that no one will ever break again.

If you make direct eye contact with your mirrored self during one of its “anomalies,” something irreversible begins. It is not immediate, and therein lies the curse. You may live days, weeks even, slowly unraveling as your reflection becomes more you than you. It begins to answer questions first. Laugh at jokes you hadn’t yet heard. Soon, others begin to see it in you. That distant look. That hollow laughter. That moment of delay before you recognize your own name.

When the final moment comes, the real you fades—not in death, but in erasure. The Mirror-Dweller takes your place, and no one will even remember you were ever there.

Avoid reflective surfaces. Water, polished metal, still glass. [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Settlements/Eldermere Sanctuary\|Eldermere Sanctuary]] craft “Veil-stained glass” that disrupts the gaze- its colors too fractured to host a dweller. Pilgrims of [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]] wear veils of ash and lacquered bone to blind their reflections. [[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]] paint the insides of their helmets with black tar to ensure they never look upon themselves.

It is said that children and the mad are most resistant, for they do not see themselves clearly enough to be taken.

There are other tells. Those taken by a Mirror-Dweller will sometimes speak in reverse, recounting events that have not yet happened, or misremembering entire lives that never were. They may step forwards when startled. They may weep when they see their reflection, not from fear, but from a sense of homecoming.

And most chilling of all: when they die, no corpse is left. Only a slick, glassy pool in the rough shape of a man.

To encounter a Mirror-Dweller is not death. It is not possession. It is not madness.

It is the quiet undoing of your being, the unwriting of your thread in the tapestry.
And all it requires is that you look…

Too late.
