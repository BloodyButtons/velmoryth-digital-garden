<center>THE SONG MADE FLESH</center>

![BEAST_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/BEAST_PORTRAIT.jpg)

There is no music in the Beast. Only agony twisted into motion. They are the closest the Choir has come to creating life—and what a life it is.

If [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/Mawlights\|Mawlights]] are madness given shape, and [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/Shatterwraiths\|Shatterwraiths]] are the quiet decay of memory, then the Beasts of Suffering are the raw violence of [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]]’s will, flung into the world like a butcher’s cleaver.

These are not creatures born, but bodies broken. People- once people, who have listened too long, prayed to the wrong silence, or simply stood too close when the veil tore open. They are the unfortunates who heard the Choir’s song not as a whisper or dream, but as a command. And they obeyed.

A Beast of Suffering wears no singular shape. They vary wildly, grotesque reflections of their original forms. A farmer becomes a tower of bone and tendons, dragging a plow of iron ribs behind it. A priest becomes a shrieking husk, arms replaced by trailing cords of sinew that strike like whips. A wolf blooms with human teeth, its eyes leaking light.

Their skin is pale, stretched taut or melted altogether, revealing black ichor and sinew beneath. The song glows from within them, a white-hot brilliance like the embers of a dying star. It pours from hollowed sockets, split jaws, ruptured chests. Those who stand too close to that glow feel it, not heat, but ache like grief made tangible.

The Choir does not shape them kindly. Their forms are pain. They exist in torment. And yet, they do not seek release. They are not mindless. They are not thoughtful. They are driven.

A Beast of Suffering will often emerge without warning, clawing itself from ruined soil, crashing down from shattered rooftops, or crawling from mirrors that no longer reflect. Once awakened it hunts. It seeks movement, seeks breath, seeks anything that is not broken yet.

What it does when it finds its prey… varies. Some tear. Some scream until the minds around them shatter. Some simply watch, and their gaze is enough to curdle blood and lock the limbs of those who meet it.

They do not speak. Not in words. But those who survive encounters with them claim they can hear something inside them. A repeating phrase. A broken plea. **“Make it stop.”**
Others hear nothing but the hymn, now howled in fractured, gurgling tones through what remains of a throat.

Beasts of Suffering do not endure however.

Their bodies burn through themselves, tearing muscle, bone, and willpower as they lash against the world. Eventually, they collapse, dissipating into oily ash and a lingering mist that smells of copper and rot. In some cases, they burst- not from damage, but from the internal pressure of their own cursed transformation. The song cannot live inside flesh forever.

Still, to kill one is no small feat. Common steel breaks against them. Arrows glance off. Fire does little.

Only blades blessed by old rites, what little divine essence remains in Velmoryth, can pierce their hides. [[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]] still carry these relics. Others seek forgotten relics from [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]] or the [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]]. The rest… pray, or die.

Conviction, too, plays its part. Some say that to strike a Beast of Suffering is to open oneself to its pain. Those with doubt in their hearts are overcome. Those with clarity may endure… for a time.

A low humming in a forest where no bird sings.

A mist that clings to the ground like clotted breath.

The corpse of a man, his bones broken inward.

A voice, not your own, begging you to stop what you haven’t yet begun.

A figure in the distance, unmoving. Glowing.

If you see one, run. If you cannot run, kneel. If you cannot kneel, then draw your blade and scream your name because you will not have long to remember it.

They are the penance of Velmoryth. The punishment for dreaming too close to the Choir.

They are not here to kill you.

They are here to make you feel what they have become.
