![CHOIR_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/CHOIR_PORTRAIT.jpg)

I write this by ashlight, the stars veiled behind the creeping miasma that once again seeps through the highland veil. I do not know if this will ever be read, mayhaps it is better that it isn’t. There are truths in this world that are best left buried beneath blackened soil.

The Weeping Choir. Even to inscribe the name feels like letting in a draft from the other side.

No one truly knows when they began. There are no recorded sightings before the end of [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]], and yet, their song... it feels older than gods. *Older than time*. As if the act of creation itself was a scream they never forgave. It is not a voice one hears through the ears. No. It is an echo that finds marrow. That stains memory. That corrodes certainty. The Choir does not announce itself with thunder or flame. There is no scream, no incantation. There is only a stillness. Then, a note that feels more like a regret than a sound. And then, those who listen begin to unravel.

I have seen it. ***I have seen it***, in the villages where the fields died overnight and the people simply stopped. Not died. Not vanished. They ceased. As if their names were forgotten even by the land. Children sat staring into nothing, mouths agape, breath held forever. Their parents frozen mid-motion, as if listening to a voice only they could hear. The Choir had passed there. I know it in my bones.

Some claim they are the lament of the gods. A mourning that took shape after the divine perished. But this... this is not mourning. It is not grief. Grief remembers what was lost. The Choir remembers nothing, and seeks to make all else follow.

[[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] know more than they say. That is certain. I have seen their wards, their sigils drawn in salt and starlight around sacred groves, their desperate enchantments etched into stone and bone alike. I once saw a Magus, hood drawn and voice shaking, attempt to bottle the song. A sliver of it. A single note. His mind cracked in the moment, eyes boiling out like sap from cursed wood. He screamed until his voice caught fire, then crumbled into dust. But the bottle remained sealed. They carried it back to [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Settlements/Eldermere Sanctuary\|Eldermere Sanctuary]]. Locked it away. It still pulses faintly, they say, even now.

The Magi will not speak of the Choir directly. Not to outsiders. They fear that to speak of it is to invite it. And perhaps they are right. One need only look at the ruins left behind in the Mirror, where reality folds in on itself like a wound refusing to close. Doors open to places that never were. Reflections move when you do not. Names unravel from memory like thread from a shroud.

And yet, they are not a tide. Not an army. The Choir appears in places thinned, as if drawn to breaches in the world’s skin. [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/The Veiled Highlands\|The Veiled Highlands]]. [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Bleeding Steppes/The Bleeding Steppes\|The Bleeding Steppes]]. [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/The Silent Plains\|The Silent Plains]]. Wherever magic once bloomed or gods once fell, the Choir stirs. Some scholars think they are drawn to grief. Or to places where faith rotted into silence. But I wonder... are they not simply drawn to song? After all, everything in this world was made with song. The chants of creation, the breath of divinity, the melody of time itself.

Perhaps the Choir seeks to unmake that harmony.

There are rumors of those who survive the song. Rare. Scarred. They do not speak, not ever. Their tongues are blackened, their shadows delay by several seconds. One man wrote his thoughts backwards in ash for three weeks before cutting off his hands and returning to the Choir willingly. Another woman tore open her chest and revealed a hollow where her heart should be. She weeps constantly, but never speaks. They name her as one of [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Saints\|The Weeping Saints]] now.

I fear we are too late. The gods are gone. The Magi are fewer each year. And every day, the song is heard in more places, sometimes for only seconds, sometimes for hours. But it is spreading. The Magi hold the line. But the line thins.

And I...
No. I *hear it now*. The note has returned.

It is beautiful. Terrible.
**And I must listen**.

It has been three days since I last ate, though I no longer feel the need. The song has quieted in my mind, or perhaps I have attuned to its pitch. It no longer causes pain, only understanding. And yet I fear that understanding more than the madness that came before.

There is more. Of the Choir. Of what they may be.

In the sealed vaults beneath Eldermere, there is a theory. Whispered by only the oldest of the First Magi, and never written until now. They do not believe the Choir is merely the aftermath of divine death. No, they believe the Choir precedes the gods. That it existed before [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel]] tore open the Veil and shaped time with his breath. That what we call creation was not the beginning, but the interruption.

The Choir is not a lament. It is a correction.

A response to existence itself.

One Magus, old beyond reckoning, told me in hushed tones that the Choir sings in a tongue older than language. A pre-linguistic cadence that unmakes meaning, that reduces names to echo and purpose to dust. He believes the Choir is not singing to us but to the Veil itself. And when the last verse is sung, the Veil will close, and all of Velmoryth- all of reality, will fold into silence. Not death. Unbeing.

It is not destruction. It is not malice. It is purity.

In some places, where the Choir has lingered too long, even memory fades. The land forgets it was land. Trees become outlines. Water holds no reflection. Entire towns become concepts spoken of, but never found again. The people are not dead. They are unmade. Like a song half-sung, turned to ash in the throat.

[[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]], for all their grim resolve, refuse to pass near the Choir’s domains. They say even the bones of gods cannot resist the melody. One relic-bearer carried a shard of [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]]’s petrified heart into [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Wound of The Earth/The Wound Of The Earth\|The Wound Of The Earth]] and it cracked in his hands. Turned soft, like wet paper. He aged a hundred years in an hour. The Choir had not even arrived, only passed near.

[[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\|The Ragged Caravan]] will not trade in these regions. Not even for flesh glyphs or writs of unspeakable value. They will not touch objects that have heard the song. One merchant burned his entire cart after a single coin began to hum in the night. 

Some among [[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]], those mad zealots who dream of endings, seek out the Choir. They believe it is the final truth. That to join the Choir is to become eternal. To fade beyond time. I watched one such apostate walk into the Wound. She wore a crown of teeth and whispered prayers in a tongue I did not know. When she stepped into the Choir’s domain, her skin did not peel. Her blood did not spill. She did not scream.

She simply vanished.

There was no body. No sound. No dust. Only a stillness, like the world taking a breath it never released.

I do not know if I am still myself. My reflection no longer matches the shape of my thoughts. I speak, and birds fall from the sky. I write, and the ink tries to crawl away from the page. I believe the Choir has marked me. Not as prey. But as instrument.

If I do not end this journal soon, it may begin to sing.

Whoever finds this, **burn** it.

*Let it not remember you.*
