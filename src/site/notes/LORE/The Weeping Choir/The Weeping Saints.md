There are those who hear the Choir and are not unmade. This is not a blessing. Do not think them immune, or chosen. They are not champions. They are not prophets. They are vessels, cracked and overflowing.

They are the Weeping Saints.

I do not use the word "saint" lightly. They do not perform miracles. They do not heal, or guide, or promise redemption. They exist. That is miracle enough.

Some say they are born beneath the note of [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]]’s whisper, pulled into breath with fragments of the song stitched into their flesh. Others claim they are those who should have been Harrowed but instead... lingered. Neither unmade nor intact, they wander the blighted places of Velmoryth with eyes hollowed by silence too loud to bear.

Their voices tremble with things they cannot say. They utter nonsense in tongues no one has taught them, or worse, truths too pure for this world to endure. One Saint I met wept blood from his mouth every time he tried to speak his own name. Another told me he had walked through three lifetimes, and in each, he watched himself die before waking again, still burdened by memory.

They do not sleep. They do not eat. Many forget how to blink. And yet, they persist.

[[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] study them with a reverence tempered by fear. They believe the Weeping Saints are anchors of sorts, points of stillness within the Choir’s unraveling. Living paradoxes. They are attuned to something beyond comprehension, and in their suffering may lie the only record of what the Choir truly is. The Magi dare not cut them open or draw sigils from their bones, fearing that to dissect a Saint is to sever the last thread tying our world to meaning.

Others, less kind, consider them omens. Doomsayers. They appear in towns before plagues erupt or miasma rolls in. Some say they draw death in their wake; others whisper that death follows to claim what it failed to the first time.

They are often confused with the [[LORE/Mortals/Strayborn\|Strayborn]]- those souls never fully born into this world, never truly claimed by life or death. And indeed, some Saints become Strayborn. Their identity frays over time, and they begin to forget themselves, their names, their shapes. But not all Strayborn are Saints. Many are something else entirely, pieces of people, the scraps left behind when the Choir removes a person but not completely.

The Saints are rarer. And unlike [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/The Harrow\|The Harrow]], they do not attack. They do not do anything. They simply exist, and by their presence, remind the world of what is slipping away.

There is one story I have heard again and again in whispers, told by dying lips in different corners of Velmoryth: that somewhere in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/The Hollow Marches\|The Hollow Marches]], a Saint sits beneath a dead tree that still casts shade. He speaks to no one. But those who listen say they return changed, unable to remember their sins, unable to lie. Some say he is the first who ever heard the Choir and survived. Others believe he is the Choir, bound into flesh.

I do not know the truth.

But I have seen a Saint pass through a camp. The air bent with him. Lamps guttered. Children forgot their mothers. For days afterward, all food tasted like iron and sorrow. But the dead stayed buried.

Some pray to them. Some kill them. Some follow them, believing that if the Saints still weep, then the world has not yet ended.

But I know better.

They do not weep for us.

They weep for the shape the world used to be. And for the silence they know must come.
