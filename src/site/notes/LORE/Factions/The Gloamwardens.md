![GLOAMWARDENS_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/GLOAMWARDENS_PORTRAIT.jpg)Deep within the mist-cloaked expanse of **[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/The Gloam Mire\|The Gloam Mire]]**, where the air is thick with the whispers of old gods and the scent of damp earth, dwell the **Gloamwardens**—keepers of some of the last untouched wilds of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Kyndreth\|Kyndreth]].

They are not a kingdom, nor an order bound by mortal law, but an ancient brotherhood, a solemn pact between those who still heed the will of the land. To outsiders, they are but ghosts of another age, their figures vanishing into the fog like wraiths, their words lost in the hush of the wind through gnarled boughs. To the people of **[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/Settlements/Gloamsrest\|Gloamsrest]]** however, they are watchers and protectors against the horrors lurking beyond the **[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/Landmarks/The Shroudway\| Shroudway]] and from within the Mire itself.** 

The Gloamwardens are clad in dark, weathered leathers and cloaks that seem woven from the very mist itself. Their armor is piecemeal—scraps of old iron, reforged time and time again, engraved with faded oaths to forgotten spirits. Over their shoulders, they wear the **Mark of the Mire**, a sigil of silver or bone, given only to those who have bled for the land.

Each warden carries a **sword**, tempered in the black waters of the Mire, its steel darkened by the strange properties of the land. These blades do not shine; they drink in the light instead. Many also bear **barbed hunting spears**, meant for creatures no ordinary weapons can fell.

The Wardens do not fight for men, nor for kings. They fight for the **balance of the land** itself, believing that the Mire holds something ancient- something that must never be disturbed. They speak of **the Slumbering Ones**, great and terrible forces beneath the water, wrapped in the roots of the oldest trees. Some say the Mire was once a sacred place of [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]] herself, and that the Gloamwardens serve as the last remnants of her will.

Their creed is simple:

- **Tread softly, lest the Mire wake.**

- **The trees listen, so we must listen in turn.**

- **The land remembers, even when men do not.**

Each year, chosen Gloamwardens take the **Pilgrimage of Silence**, traveling the **Shroudway**. Those who return speak little of what they saw in the mist, but they are forever changed.

Every Warden must forge their own weapon, tempering it in the waters of the Mire. Should they falter, the weapon shatters, unworthy to serve.

When a Warden dies, their body is not buried, nor burned. Instead, they are given to the Mire, their sword driven into the earth beside them, where the trees may claim it.

The Gloamwardens stand against **poachers, defilers, and those who would despoil the land for their own ends**. They are locked in a silent war against **[[The Flesh Merchants\|The Flesh Merchants]]**, who seek the Mire’s strange and shifting creatures for their trade in twisted meat and bone. Worse still the Mire is not empty it teems with **eldritch things**, with forms that do not belong, and voices that speak from beneath the bog.

The greatest fear of the Gloamwardens, however, is that one day the Mire will no longer remain asleep. That something beneath its waters will rise again. And when that day comes they will either be its last defenders, or its first victims. 

Occasionally the passing [[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\| Steel Apparition]] will come, offering some semblance of support from [[LORE/Factions/The Lasthearth Tribunal\|The Lasthearth Tribunal]], but these occasions are becoming fewer and farther in between in recent years.
