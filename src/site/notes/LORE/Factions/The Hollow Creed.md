The Hollow Creed is more than a mere cult; it is a solemn acceptance of the world's inevitable decay. To its adherents, Velmoryth is a corpse, and all who fight against its demise are merely delaying the inevitable silence that must come.

Unlike [[LORE/Factions/The Blooded Covenant\|The Blooded Covenant]], who chase power, the Hollow Creed holds no illusions. The gods are dead, the world is dying, and no force, mortal or divine, can change this fate. Instead of railing against the end, they embrace it, believing that only through complete erasure can peace be found.

The majority of the Creed mourn the world but accept its fate, living as wandering scholars, poets, and quiet reapers of the fallen. The Hands of Ash, seek to hasten the end, actively destroying old ruins, artifacts, and resisting all attempts to rebuild civilization. The Inheritors believe Velmoryth can be remade, but only after it has been fully cleansed of its lingering gods and their corruption. They walk the ruins, watching, waiting.

Most mortals fear the Creed, whispering that they are agents of oblivion, seeking to snuff out even the last embers of hope. Others claim that they are merely pragmatists, resigned to truth, weary of false promises of rebirth.

Within the walls of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Wound of The Earth/Settlements/The Black Hollow\|The Black Hollow]], the Creed gathers, debating how best to face the end. Some seek only to preserve history, recording the final days of Velmoryth in great monastic archives. Others believe that history itself should be erased, ensuring no future beings ever resurrect the folly of the past.

[[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]], while not enemies, find themselves at odds with the Hollow Creed’s desire to erase memory itself. The Dirge-Bearers seek to honor the fallen, while the Creed seeks to unmake all that remains.


Some say that when the final hour comes, it will be the Creed who close the door on Velmoryth and walk into the void, never to return.
