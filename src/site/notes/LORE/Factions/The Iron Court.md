<center>DHORAK'S LAST GUARD</center>

![COURT_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/COURT_PORTRAIT.jpg)
Deep within [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/Settlements/The Crucible\|The Crucible]], beneath the scorched and shattered [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\| Hungering Ridge]], the Iron Court rules over the last remnants of dwarven civilization. They are not kings in the way of old, nor are they simple warlords. They are wardens of the mountain, bound by rusted chains of duty and unbroken oaths, sworn to guard what should never be unearthed.

The [[LORE/Mortals/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] of the Crucible were once master smiths, forging weapons for the gods and mortals alike. But the fall of [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]] left their forges cold and their purpose shattered. With their god’s death,
the dwarves turned inward, retreating into the depths trying to cling on to what remained of their once-proud heritage. The Iron Court rose from this despair, a conclave of the last great dwarven lords, each bound by an ancient duty: to stand eternal vigil over the last remnants of their god’s will.

Their rule is absolute. The deeper one delves into the Crucible, the greater the price of entry. Dwarves do not speak of their rulers in casual conversation - only in whispers and fear for summoning the Iron Court is to invoke judgment.

The Court does not concern itself with the wars of the surface. They send no armies, they forge no alliances - save for their tenuous relationship with [[LORE/Factions/The Lasthearth Tribunal\|The Lasthearth Tribunal]]. The dwarves of the Crucible are self-contained, a world unto themselves. Few outsiders are permitted beyond the outer halls, and fewer still leave. Some surface dwellers whisper of forges still burning beneath the mountains, of weapons being crafted for a war that has not yet come.

The dwarves who remain speak little of what lies below. Those who leave often do so with shattered minds, muttering of things in the dark, of whispers in the forge, of something that should have been left buried.

Some believe it is Dhorak’s last, unfinished creation, an artifact of unfathomable power that could rekindle the divine forges or undo the last remnants of his will.

Others claim that it is not a weapon, but a prison—something sealed away before the gods fell, something that should never wake.

Nevertheless, the Iron Court stands guard, their rusted banners hanging in silence, their armor fused to their flesh by years of ceaseless duty. They do not speak of what lies below, but they never cease their watch.
