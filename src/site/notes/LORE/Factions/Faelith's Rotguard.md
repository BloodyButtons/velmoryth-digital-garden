![ROTGUARD_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/ROTGUARD_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The Rotguard are taller, denser, and more armored than typical [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]], their fungal carapaces hardened over decades of battle. Some bear wooden plating, others have bone-like chitin, while the oldest among them have fused with the land itself, their bodies adorned with vines and flowering growths.

They wield weapons of root and decay, great spore-lances, jagged swords grown from hardened bark, and whips of thorned vines that lash with unnatural speed.

The Rotguard do not seek conquest, but they defend the [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/Settlements/The Chapel of Decay\| Chapel]] fiercely, striking down any who would seek to exploit the [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/The Verdant Ruin\|The Verdant Ruin]]’s unnatural bounty. Many believe they guard something deeper within, an ancient secret left behind by [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]] herself.

The Mycari of the Chapel do not seek war, but they do not trust outsiders. They see the decay of the world, the dying lands beyond the Ruin, and wonder if they are meant to be the inheritors of Velmoryth’s remains. Some whisper that Faelith’s death was not the end, that the Blooming Mother still lingers within the roots, waiting to return.

But whether the Chapel is a sanctuary or the harbinger of something far more terrifying remains to be seen.
