<center>TENUOUS CIVILITY</center> 

---

The Lasthearth Tribunal is not a council of equals, nor a dynasty of sovereigns. It is an uneasy pact between necessity and ideology, a tenuous coalition of those who refuse to let the last city fall into ruin. Comprised of Scholars, Exiles, and Warlords, the Tribunal governs not through unity, but through constant negotiation, measured concessions, and silent wars of influence waged behind closed doors. They do not rule out of ambition, but out of an unspoken agreement that no one else can be trusted to hold the weight of civilization in their hands.

The Scholars once priests, historians, and architects of forgotten empires- even some past members of [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] seek to preserve the remnants of the past, not as idle nostalgia, but as the last embers of wisdom in a world rapidly fading into ignorance. They are the keepers of The Archive, the vast subterranean vault beneath Lasthearth where every known fragment of divine law, mortal history, and eldritch scripture is cataloged and sealed. They alone remember the gods as they were, not as myths or curses, but as entities who shaped the world before their fall. It is they who safeguard the old texts on magic, ensuring that what little power remains is not squandered or misused. They oversee the bureaucratic arm of Lasthearth’s law, where edicts are written and rewritten, where the borders of justice are drawn, erased, and redrawn with every shifting tide of power. Their belief is that knowledge, not war, will be the city's salvation, and that through careful governance the fragile civilization within Lasthearth’s walls can endure.

Yet knowledge alone cannot hold the walls against the horrors outside.

The Exiles, known in whispers as the Veilmarked, are those who have seen too much of the world and yet returned to tell of it. Wanderers, seers, and cursed souls who have braved [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/The Hollow Marches\|The Hollow Marches]], touched the edge of [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/The Sunken Expanse\|The Sunken Expanse]], or stared too long into the abyss of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Wound of The Earth/Landmarks/The Mirror\|the Thousandfold Gate]]. They do not govern through laws, but through warnings. To them, Lasthearth is a sanctuary not just from war and famine, but from something far worse- the creeping annihilation that devours everything beyond its borders. They oversee the Outer Watch, the unseen sentinels who move beyond the walls, mapping the shifting decay of Velmoryth, ensuring that the city is always prepared for what lurks beyond. It is their warnings that guide the Tribunal’s hand in matters of external threats, their whispered truths that dictate whether the gates remain open to travelers or sealed against unseen horrors. They have no official power, yet even the most hardened Warlord will not ignore a Veilmarked’s prophecy.

Then there are the Warlords, the strongest and most dangerous of the Tribunal, who rule not with wisdom, nor prophecy, but with steel. They command the city’s armies, dictate its wartime laws, and ensure that survival is paid for in blood. In the ashes of fallen kingdoms, many of them were kings, warleaders, or knight-commanders, now reduced to pragmatic soldiers who understand that strength is the only currency left in the world. The Warlords oversee the Iron Guard, Lasthearth’s military, the only force still capable of standing against the horrors that gather beyond the city walls. They do not suffer weakness, nor do they entertain idealism, their role is to keep the city breathing no matter the cost. To them the Scholars are deluded dreamers, clinging to dead knowledge, and the Exiles are nothing but madmen waiting to bring ruin upon Lasthearth with their superstitions. Yet even they recognize that they cannot rule alone without the Scholars, the city would descend into lawless brutality; without the Exiles, they would march into wars they could never win.

Together, these factions form a government that is equal parts order and chaos, bound not by loyalty, but by the knowledge that without one another, Lasthearth would collapse into anarchy. Law and justice within the city are not dictated by a single hand, but by a constant push and pull between these three powers. 

Beneath this fragile balance, there are rivalries as deep as blood feuds. The Warlords believe that the only path forward is conquest, to reclaim the land and carve a new dominion from the ashes of Velmoryth. The Scholars oppose this, for they have seen the fate of empires that sought to war against the inevitable. The Exiles watch from the shadows, knowing that all of it- the wars, the laws, the struggles for power, are merely delaying the inevitable.

The Tribunal, for all its power, is not eternal. There will come a time when the brittle alliance of war, knowledge, and prophecy will shatter. When the iron will of the Warlords, the whispers of the Exiles, and the fragile wisdom of the Scholars will fail to find common ground. When the city will either stand as the last ember of civilization, or become just another ruin in the long, slow decay of Velmoryth.

Until then, the Tribunal endures, not as rulers, but as the last arbiters of a world long past saving. And yet, a select few still carry the flame...

[[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]] are both a legend and a reality within Lasthearth. They are not soldiers, nor are they rulers; they do not answer to the Tribunal, nor do they wholly defy it. They are an echo of what knights once were, an order without a master, bound not by fealty, but by purpose. To some, they are the last vestige of honor in a world long abandoned by gods and kings. To others they are relics of a dead age, aimless warriors clinging to an outdated code.

Though many roam the wastelands beyond the city walls, some still return to Lasthearth, for even ghosts must rest. They are seen in the halls of the Ashen Keep, standing like statues in the shadows, their presence acknowledged but seldom spoken of. They do not hold seats of power, nor do they seek them. They are not rulers, nor enforcers, yet their presence carries weight.

The Tribunal tolerates the Steel Apparitions, but does not command them. They have no official authority, no sanctioned rank, yet they are permitted within the city gates, unchallenged and unbound. The Scholars respect them, for they are the last keepers of forgotten chivalry, warriors who still cling to ideals long since buried beneath the ash of fallen empires. The Exiles watch them warily recognizing in them kindred souls, men and women who have seen too much, who walk paths that lead only to oblivion. The Warlords of the Tribunal distrust them most of all, for they see the Apparitions as dangerous anomalies, warriors who obey no law but their own. Behind closed doors, they prepare for the day the knights could turn on their fading city, for if what they did in the shadows was known, it could spell the destabilizing of everything.

Yet, even the Iron Guard dare not challenge the Apparitions outright. There is an unspoken rule in Lasthearth: the Apparitions are beyond law, beyond judgment. They are knights who no longer swear to lords, warriors who are neither friend nor foe. If they commit a crime, it is not punished, for it is understood that they answer to something higher than mortal justice.

Despite their estrangement from governance, the Steel Apparitions serve a purpose in Lasthearth that no one else can.

When concerning [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Shattered Coast/Settlements/The Den\|The Den]], the Tribunal is diametrically opposed to its ethos, yet it does not wage open war against it. A necessary evil, a lurking rot, The Den exists because no force has yet risen to burn it away. While the Tribunal denounces its trade in flesh, stolen relics, and blasphemous pacts with [[LORE/Factions/The Blooded Covenant\|The Blooded Covenant]], it lacks the forces to completely eradicate it.

The Den, in turn, views Lasthearth as a fortress of hypocrites, a city that claims neutrality yet judges from afar, unwilling to descend and bring justice with its own hands. [[LORE/Factions/The Warlords of The Den\|The Warlords of The Den]] care nothing for the Tribunal’s decrees, but they recognize that direct conflict would bring disastrous retaliation. A cold understanding exists: so long as The Den’s filth does not reach Lasthearth’s gates, the Tribunal will not march upon it.

Where the Iron Guard cannot act, the Steel Apparitions do. Though bound by no law, many Apparitions despise The Den, seeing it as a manifestation of all that is wrong in the world. They do not storm its walls directly, but they hunt its slavers on the roads, destroy its trade routes, and cut down warlords who grow too bold.

Some Apparitions are more pragmatic, understanding that The Den provides Lasthearth with vital intelligence, a necessary devil in a world already lost. Yet others see no compromise, believing that so long as The Den exists, there will never be true order.

While the Tribunal will never openly sanction the Apparitions’ crusade, neither will it stop them. In this, the Apparitions act as Lasthearth’s unspoken blade, a force that moves in the grey between law and necessity.

And in the shadows of the broken world, the battle continues- one of law against anarchy, of justice against profit, of knights against barbarism and chaos.

A war that neither side will ever truly win.
