![MAGI_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/MAGI_PORTRAIT.jpg)

**“They are not saviors, nor martyrs, nor villains. They are the ones who knew, who acted, and who still remember.”**  

In the age before silence, before the Veil was sundered by time, there stood the Architect of Order: **[[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]]**, whose will was law, and whose greatest creation was **[[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Eternal Lexicon\|The Eternal Lexicon]]**- a living scripture through which reality itself was bound. Magic, in that era, was not wielded. It was **obeyed**. Mortals did not cast spells; they enacted decrees. They did not shape the world; they fulfilled its written design.

But within the perfect machine of Syltharien’s vision stirred doubt. The [[LORE/Mortals/Elves\|Elves]]—his children, his law-bound creations, began to **question the righteousness of servitude**. Among them arose a quiet conspiracy, a covenant not of war but of **withheld obedience**. They would take the Lexicon not to destroy it, but to **free it**.

Thus were born **The First Magi**.

Their theft shattered the god’s illusion of control, igniting the **Elvish Liberation**, and setting in motion the great chain of calamities that led to **[[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]]** and in time, the **death of the gods**. It is a weight the First Magi carry still, though whether they wear it as shame or penance is known only to them.

Where others in this dying world wield magic like a blade **fuelled by sacrifice, rot, and unremembered names**, the First Magi **preserve the old way**, drawn from what fragments of the Lexicon they could save. Their magic is subtle, deliberate, and utterly foreign to those schooled in the bloody rites of [[LORE/Chronology/The Age of Decay\|The Age of Decay]]. They weave spells with **sigils carved into silverleaf bark**, speak incantations written in **languages no longer spoken aloud**, and bind power not through pain, but through **balance and intent**.

Their miracles are not loud. They do not conjure flame or summon storms. But they **heal soil**, **cleanse cursed water**, and whisper old memories back into broken minds. It is magic as it was meant to be, **a negotiation with the world**, not its defilement.

The First Magi dwell now in the forgotten refuge of **[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Settlements/Eldermere Sanctuary\|Eldermere Sanctuary]]**, a living sanctuary on the edge of the [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/The Veiled Highlands\|The Veiled Highlands]]. The Highlands accept them recognizing the ancient sorrow they carry. The land itself veils Eldermere from the world. Few who seek it ever arrive. Most forget what they were looking for and wander back, empty-handed and unsettled.

They are organized not by title, but by **Path**:

- The **Path of Memory** guards what little remains of the Lexicon, archiving spells as living thought and etched song.
    
- The **Path of Growth** communes with the land, tending to its health, and shaping its will alongside their own.
    
- The **Path of Silence** defends Eldermere not with blade or flame, but with **illusions, misdirection, and magicks that unmake desire itself**.
    

When they must fight, and it is rare, they do so **by ensuring the battle never begins**.

They are whispered of in most corners of Velmoryth, though the words change with the mouth that speaks:

- **[[LORE/Factions/The Perpetual Order\|The Perpetual Order]]** of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/Settlements/Rustcradle\|Rustcradle]] would see them **ground into ash**, should they breach [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/The Iron Wastes\|The Iron Wastes]]. The Lexicon’s theft is, in their eyes, **the greatest sin**. A breach of divine law for which the world still suffers.
    
- **[[LORE/Factions/The Blooded Covenant\|The Blooded Covenant]]** hungers for them. They believe the blood of a First Magus contains **raw divinity**, and covet it for their monstrous ascension.
    
- **[[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]]** scorns them as **remnants of a dream already dead**, clinging to a hope they do not share.
    
- **[[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]]** revere them, in a quiet way, believing the First Magi **guard the last note of the gods’ true voice**.
    
- Even within **[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Ashen Reaches/Settlements/Lasthearth\|Lasthearth]]**, they are viewed with suspicion. Scholars envy their knowledge. Warlords distrust their secrecy. And the Tribunal? They watch. Always.
    

Only **[[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]]**, perhaps, treat them without scorn or fear. Some among their hollow ranks carry memories of a different world. And sometimes, an Apparition walks alone into the highlands, never to be seen again.

The First Magi claim no thrones. They do not rule. They do not build cities or make war. What they do is **remember**. They **tend to the flame** of what magic once was not in hope of restoring the old world, but in hope that **something else might yet grow**.

It is said that on rare nights, when the plain hushes, one might hear a single voice speaking the Lexicon aloud beneath the moonlit sky. The words are not meant for mortals. But the earth listens.

And it remembers who broke the world… and who might one day mend it.
