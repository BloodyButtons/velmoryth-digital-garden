In the shrouded reticence of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/The Silent Plains\|The Silent Plains]], where the wind does not whisper and [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]]’s song does not reach, the Dirge-Bearers tread their solemn path. They are the keepers of a burden none asked for, yet one they refuse to abandon. Their purpose is singular and unwavering, to carry the remains of the dead gods to their final rest.

The Dirge-Bearers are cloaked in tattered robes of deep gray and black, their garments marked with the sigils of gods who no longer answer. Across their backs, they bear reliquaries of bones, broken divine relics, and crumbling icons, each a piece of a deity who once shaped the world. These remnants are not for worship, nor for power, but for remembrance and reverence. To them, the gods are not divine saviors, nor masters, but fallen titans whose echoes must be laid to rest.

Each Dirge-Bearer embarks on an eternal pilgrimage across [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Kyndreth\|Kyndreth]], seeking the last traces of their gods. When they find a relic, whether a shard of divine steel, a withered root from [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]]’s corpse, or an inscription of [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn]]’s lost decrees, they bear it to [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/Settlements/Grimholt\|Grimholt]], the silent monastic fortress in the heart of the plains. There these remnants are entombed in great sepulchers, guarded against those who would steal divinity for themselves.

While the Dirge-Bearers are not warlike by nature, their path is one of sacred duty. When they encounter grave robbers, cultists, or members of [[LORE/Factions/The Blooded Covenant\|The Blooded Covenant]], they abandon their solemnity and become relentless warriors. They fight with funeral blades, rusted weapons sanctified by the passing of time, and iron censers filled with smoldering ashes, which they use to burn away those who defile the dead.

When roused to battle, they chant hollow hymns, dirges of mourning that do not stir the Choir, but still chill the soul.

Their armor is scavenged from tombs and relic-hoards, often rusted, gilded, or mismatched, a reflection of their belief that all things must return to dust.

They strike with measured precision, never reckless, never wasting movement - for to them, every battle is a funeral.

Though united in their duty, the Dirge-Bearers do not all agree on what should be done with the divine remnants they carry.

Some believe they must be interred forever, sealed away where no mortal may reach them.

Others seek to restore what little divinity remains, not to worship but to bring balance back to the world.

A few whisper that the gods might be reborn, if only their remnants were gathered together once more.


These divisions have led to a slow, festering rift in their order which the Blooded Covenant seeks to exploit. The Covenant, those who sacrifice flesh to [[LORE/Factions/The Wraith-Kings\|The Wraith-Kings]] and False Gods, see the Dirge-Bearers as deluded fools hoarding power that should be used, not buried. The Covenant has long sought to steal divine remnants for their own dark rituals, believing they can consume what remains of the gods and rise as new deities in their place.

Dirge-Bearers and the Covenant are locked in an endless war, one fought in the shadows of tombs, in ruined temples, and along the forsaken roads of Kyndreth.

When the two orders meet, there is no mercy, no hesitation - for the Dirge-Bearers know that if the Covenant claims the last remnants of divinity, Velmoryth will never escape the shadow of false gods and butcher-kings.


Thus, they march onward, never resting, never relenting, their journey one of endless mourning for gods long dead, and for a world that may never be reborn or find salvation.
