The Blooded Covenant is no mere warband, no simple congregation of zealots- it is a pact, a lineage of warriors, priests, and prophets bound by a singular, terrible purpose. They do not kneel to the gods of old for they know the gods are dead. Nor do they seek the mercy of lost divinity, for there is no mercy left in Velmoryth. Instead they devour what remains of godhood, seeking to take divinity into themselves, forging a new pantheon from their own blood and suffering.

To the uninitiated, the Covenant appears as a horde of war-mongering butchers, a brutal collective of murderers exalting in slaughter. But their violence is not without structure, not without intent. Every drop of blood spilled upon [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Bleeding Steppes/The Bleeding Steppes\|The Bleeding Steppes]] is an offering, every duel a rite, every battle a sacrament in the liturgy of ascension. To kill is to prove oneself worthy, to die is to serve as fuel for those stronger. This belief is not metaphorical. It is absolute.

Their rituals are gruesome, their sacraments written in viscera and agony. Blood is the essence of power, for it is the one thing that all living things possess, and through it, they believe, they may claim the fractured echoes of lost divinity. They brand themselves with the marks of old gods, symbols of a pantheon they intend to replace rather than restore. Their bodies are altars, their skin carved with the names of forgotten deities, their bones hollowed and reforged into relics. To bear a relic of divinity is to wield a piece of the power that once shaped the world, and to wield it long enough is to let it reshape you.

Their most sacred site is [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Bleeding Steppes/Settlements/The Forsaken Ascent\|The Forsaken Ascent]], a spiraling arena carved into the broken land, where warriors climb, ascending through slaughter. Only those who survive may take the next step toward their profane enlightenment. But not all ascensions are the same. Some drink deep of the blood of their foes, believing strength alone is the key to deification. Others seek the remnants of godhood left scattered across the land in divine relics, fragments of shattered celestial bodies, bones of the fallen deities and objects that still hum with power, twisted by time and mortal hands.

The highest echelon of the Covenant, those known as the Bloodsaints, have begun their transformation. Through relentless war, through the devouring of sacred flesh, through the binding of relics into their very bones, they have begun to change. Their skin thickens, hardening like old, dried blood. Their eyes burn with an unnatural light. Some grow monstrous, limbs twisting, bodies bloated with power, barely mortal half-formed gods who lack only the final piece of ascension.

This is the true goal of the Blooded Covenant: to steal the divine mantle for themselves, to forge a new pantheon from their own strength, their own suffering, their own hunger. They do not wait for gods to return, nor do they weep for their absence. They seek to become gods themselves, not through worship, nor faith, but through bloodshed, through war, through a relentless and unforgiving trial of carnage.

Yet there is a great and terrible truth that none of them will speak aloud, not even in their blood-soaked rituals.

What if the gods died not because they were weak, but because divinity itself is a curse?

What if to ascend is to inherit not only power, but the inevitable doom that claimed those before them?

What if the gods were not killed but fled?

The Covenant does not question. They do not doubt. They climb, they kill, they devour, and they ascend.

The Hollow Veins await. The last relics of the divine slumber beneath the earth. Their war is not yet won. Their pantheon is not yet born.

But it will be. No matter the cost.
