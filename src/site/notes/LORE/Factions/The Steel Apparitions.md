The Steel Apparitions are neither an army nor an order. They are an idea, a remnant of chivalry and duty that refuses to die, even when all else has been lost. Some call them knights of a dead world, others wandering executioners, and to the desperate, they are the last flickering light in a suffocating darkness.

They are not bound by a central command, nor do they answer to kings or councils. Instead, they operate in loose brotherhoods, solitary paths, or whispered oaths shared between fading warriors. They are the last echoes of a world that once knew honor, and they fight, not to restore it, but because no one else will.

The Apparitions were once knights, warlords, and guardians of old codes, bound by the laws of their gods and the decrees of their kings. But the War of Hubris shattered all bonds—the gods died, the kings fell to madness or ruin, and the orders that once stood as beacons of justice became twisted mockeries of their former selves.

Some knights chose to abandon their oaths entirely, becoming nothing more than mercenaries or butchers. Others clung desperately to the past, enforcing meaningless decrees for lords who no longer ruled.

But the ones who became the Steel Apparitions did something different. They forsook their names, their lands and their banners not out of despair, but so they might act where no one else dared. They would not serve kings, but they would serve the world itself, even as it decayed around them.

Thus, they became phantoms of the battlefield, nameless knights with no masters, their only law the judgment they carried in steel.

The Apparitions do not gather in fortresses or strongholds. They do not ride in banners or march in armies. Instead, they travel alone or in small bands, moving from ruin to ruin, battlefield to battlefield, judging, protecting, and punishing as they see fit.

Some hunt the horrors that plague the land, cutting down Wraith-Kings, False Gods, and Beasts of Suffering.

Others deliver justice where none remains, cutting through slavers, warlords, and those who prey upon the weak.

A few seek to preserve what little hope remains, protecting sanctuaries, defending pilgrims, or simply ensuring the last embers of civilization do not go out. And some… some simply fight because they do not know how to do anything else.

They follow no singular doctrine, but all share one unspoken vow:

“Where this world fails, we will not.”

There is no initiation into the Steel Apparitions, no grand ceremony or binding oath. One does not join them- one simply becomes. A knight who casts aside his name, discards his sigil, and chooses the path of the Apparitions is already one of them.
A war-weary soldier who cannot stomach serving another warlord may find themselves walking their path. A lost soul, broken and wandering, might take up a blade for something greater than survival.

Some Apparitions recognize kindred spirits in the world, testing them with trials of battle and conviction. Those who endure are not granted titles, but simply accepted as one of their own.

There is no formal hierarchy, only those who have walked the path longer, those who have survived more battles, and those who have yet to fall.

The Apparitions are not agents of Lasthearth, yet they are allowed within its walls. The Iron Guard tolerates them, but sees them as unpredictable, warriors who do not follow orders and do not abide by Lasthearth’s laws. The Tribunal understands that the Apparitions are necessary, but it does not control them.

Some within the Guard despise them, believing they undermine the city’s authority.

Others see them as allies, albeit reckless ones, warriors who carry out the justice Lasthearth cannot afford to enforce.

It is a tenuous relationship, one built on unspoken necessity rather than trust.

The Steel Apparitions and The Den are in a constant shadow war. Apparitions raid their slave caravans, burn their black markets, and cut down their warlords whenever they grow too bold. They refuse to compromise, seeing The Den as a wound upon the world.

The Blooded Covenant, however, is something else entirely. The Apparitions do not hunt them like they do The Den, for the Covenant’s power is far greater, its presence more elusive.

Some Apparitions seek to end their profane rites, believing their ascension must be stopped at all costs.

Others acknowledge the Covenant as a force too great to strike outright, choosing instead to strike at its supply lines, disrupt its rituals, and slay its lesser priests.


Whatever the case, there is no peace between them—only an unspoken understanding that war is inevitable.


The Apparitions are viewed as both saviors and harbingers of death across Velmoryth. The Hollow Creed sees them as fools, warriors clinging to a world that is already dead. The Perpetual Order considers them lawless aberrations, knights with no decree, no guiding principle but their own flawed morality. The Weeping Choir sings of them, for many Apparitions have walked into the Choir’s embrace, seeking an end to their endless war.

To some, they are beacons of hope, the last flickers of resistance against the abyss.
To others, they are relics of a world long past, refusing to fade.

The Steel Apparitions know that they will not win.

The world will not be saved by a handful of warriors wandering through its corpse.

The old ways will not return, and the honor they once swore to protect is gone.

Yet still, they fight.

Not because they believe in victory, not because they think they can change the world—
But because someone has to.

In a world ruled by false kings, warlords, and horrors, where justice has become a myth and power is the only law…

They choose to stand.

They walk the roads beyond the city walls, facing horrors that the average man dare not confront.
They do not seek gold, nor power, only purpose—many of them offer their blades freely to the desperate, defending the weak. If a warlord grows too cruel, they will strike them down. If a noble hides behind power, they will drag them into the dust.

They are wanderers, watchers, quiet protectors. They do not rule, nor do they serve, yet when the all is threatened, they are the first to draw their blades.

When the time comes, when the world is truly on the brink, when the dead rise and the sky bleeds- 

They will die.
They will be forgotten.
Their names will not be sung in history’s last dirges.

But so long as one still walks, blade in hand, defying the tide...

The world has not yet fallen.
