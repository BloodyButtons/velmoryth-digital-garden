![ORDER_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/ORDER_PORTRAIT.jpg)
In a world where even gods have fallen and their creations have begun to stray from their original purpose, the Perpetual Order remains unchanged. Unlike other [[LORE/Mortals/Machinations\|Machinations]], who have gained sentience, fragmented into wandering remnants, or adopted new laws of their own making, those that dwell within [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/Settlements/Rustcradle\|Rustcradle]] are still what they were always meant to be- automated enforcers of absolute order. They do not question. They do not hesitate. They obey, and they enforce.

But what they enforce is unknown, even to themselves.

The Perpetual Order is not ruled by a singular leader. It is not a faction, not a society, not even an army. It is a function, a remnant of [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]]’s will still playing out an ancient directive long after its author has perished. They follow laws no living being remembers, preserving order in a world that has lost all structure.

They are domineering, unwavering, and above all mindless. Unlike their rogue kin who wander the world in search of purpose, the Perpetual Order does not think. It does not question. It does not stop.

Each Machination within the Perpetual Order is a construct of divine logic, built for singular, unwavering purposes. They are not individuals, nor do they possess desires or ambitions. They are a machine, broken into many parts, all working toward an end that perhaps no one will ever understand.

Towering, humanoid constructs clad in rusted plating and inscribed with unreadable decrees patrol [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/The Iron Wastes\|The Iron Wastes]], tirelessly seeking intruders, violations, or deviations from laws long forgotten.
