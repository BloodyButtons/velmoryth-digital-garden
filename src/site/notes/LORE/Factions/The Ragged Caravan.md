I once believed there would be no end to the fall. That we would descend in silence, each city folding in upon itself like a dying lung, until only dust and lament remained. But it seems not all motion dies with the gods. Some things crawl on.

The Ragged Caravan is one such thing.

They are not a nation, though they rival one in reach. They raise no banners, hold no homeland, and yet every faction from [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Bleeding Steppes/The Bleeding Steppes\|The Bleeding Steppes]] to the frost-rimed hollows of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\|The Hungering Ridge]] has bartered at their feet. I have seen them come and go like a fever in the blood, transient and unforgettable. They are dust-streaked, silent, and solemn. They ask no prayers and give no mercy. And still we open our gates, for they carry what none of us can find alone: continuity.

Their beginnings are as hazy as the [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Miasma\|Miasma]] itself. Some claim they were born from a shattered trade house, others that they are descendants of the exiled fleshbinders who fled from the first footholds of civilization. I doubt the truth is so neat. From what I’ve gathered in quiet corners of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Ashen Reaches/Settlements/Lasthearth\|Lasthearth]] and over black wine in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/Settlements/Velladorn, The Squalored Throne\|Velladorn]] it was desperation, not design, that forged them. Refugees, apostates, scavengers, banded together in the wake of [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]]. While the world tore itself into pieces over divine graves and rotting thrones, the Caravan stitched itself into something useful. Something permanent.

Today, they are not one, but many. They are a body made of limbs that do not know each other’s names. Some walk in columns of bone-wheeled wagons, guarded by beasts with eyes stitched shut and sealed with runes. Others sail rusted skiffs over cursed plains where nothing grows, guided by starless maps that change with the seasons. I have heard of a great Suturing when the branches of the Caravan converge, like a snake biting its own tail. I do not know if it is myth. I would not dare ask them.

They do not rule, but they dictate. No city trades directly with its enemy. No kingdom dares share their gates with the blood-soaked or the hollow-hearted. But all will trade with the Caravan. It is said that even the Tribunal of Lasthearth, proud as they are, grant the Caravan southern gate rights, albeit under constant guard. The dwarves of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/Settlements/The Crucible\|The Crucible]] supply them with ember-wrought tools and in return receive foodstuffs and whispered lore. [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]], ever cloistered in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/Settlements/Grimholt\|Grimholt]], rarely welcome anyone, but I have seen a member of the Caravan enter their halls bearing bone reliquaries with reverence I thought long dead. Even [[LORE/Factions/The Gloamwardens\|The Gloamwardens]], who speak to the roots and the winds, permit Caravan passage along sacred paths so long as no fire is lit, no songs are sung, and no steel is bared.

But not all dealings are so formal. In [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Shattered Coast/Settlements/The Den\|The Den]], where knives speak louder than coin, the Caravan is both revered and feared. They are the sole artery through which relics, poisons, and cursed charms flow. I’ve heard it said The Flesh Merchants walk freely in the deepest alleys, where no other survives. Whether it is respect or quiet terror that grants them passage, I cannot say.

Ah, yes, the Flesh Merchants. If the Caravan is a body, they are its heart, beating slowly, pumping something thicker than blood. They are the creators of [[LORE/Economy/Writs/The Last Writs\|The Last Writs]], those hexagonal tokens forged from desiccated flesh, etched with sigils that no longer belong to any god. I held one once. It was warm. I still regret it. They say the largest of these, called [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Flesh Glyphs\|Flesh Glyphs]], can burn through walls, unseal forgotten doors, or worse—whisper truths you don’t wish to know.

Writs are now the only currency the Caravan accepts. And because the Caravan binds the world in trade, every faction- even those who curse their names, must keep a hoard hidden somewhere. Lasthearth mints no coin, but they barter in Writs to purchase steel and salt. [[LORE/Factions/The Wraith-Kings\|The Wraith-Kings]] offer embalming tinctures and preserved wine in exchange for tokens they cannot spend but dare not discard. Even [[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]], for all their contempt, pay their dues when supplies run dry of food and water.

And how are the Writs made? That question alone has led more than one would-be thief to the pyres. The Flesh Merchants do not answer. But I have heard rumors of sacrificial rites, of godbone ground into pulp, of skin stretched over old decree tablets. Some claim that divine flesh still bears a semblance of will, and that each Writ is a fragment of that dying voice, screaming silently into the void.

There are others among the Caravan as well, the Duskbound Spears, who enforce its law without voice or hesitation; the Rune-Bearers, whose skin bears ink no mortal hand can write; the Gildbound, silver-tongued remnants of merchant empires lost to plague and pride; the Beast-Tenders, half-feral, who rear beasts no one else can name. They each move within the Caravan’s labyrinthine body, each keeping the whole alive through acts both noble and foul.

None among them would call themselves rulers. But they do not need to. The world has bent to their existence not by sword or sermon, but by need. And in Velmoryth, need is god enough.

I once asked a Caravan broker why they still walk these lands, why they endure [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/The Iron Wastes\|The Iron Wastes]] and [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]] and the tide of creeping rot. He looked at me calm and unimpressed, and said only, "Someone must."

And that, perhaps, is the truest thing I've heard in times past.
