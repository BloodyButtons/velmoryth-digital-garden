![WRAITHKING_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/WRAITHKING_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The Wraith-Kings of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/Settlements/Velladorn, The Squalored Throne\|Velladorn, The Squalored Throne]] are not so much rulers as they are revenant relics, vestiges of once-noble bloodlines entombed within a decaying dream of splendor. It was once the seat of [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn]]’s favored bloodline, a city crowned in gold and law. Now, it is a festering masquerade, preserved in death by those who cannot, or will not, acknowledge the world’s decay. Within its marble halls and crumbling manors masked nobles waltz endlessly through hollow festivals, surrounded by rotted silk, embalmed courtiers, and decayed jesters. The Wraith-Kings reign here as spectral monarchs- undead lords bound by obsession, pride, and some deeper, unspoken rot.

To outsiders, the Wraith-Kings are considered a grotesque mockery of rule as undead sovereigns draped in delusion, clinging to vanished oaths. Most factions treat Velladorn with a mixture of fear and disdain. [[LORE/Factions/The Lasthearth Tribunal\|The Lasthearth Tribunal]] forbids trade with the Wraith-Kings, declaring their kingdom a “corpse state.” Even [[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]] avoid its boundaries, claiming that the laws there have long since unraveled. [[LORE/Factions/The Blooded Covenant\|The Blooded Covenant]], by contrast, considers the Wraith-Kings apostate fools, undead clinging to life rather than embracing the sacrament of blood and transcendence.

And yet, Velladorn remains curiously... functional. [[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\|The Ragged Caravan]], ever neutral, does occasionally pass through its gates. There, in candlelit marketplaces and echoing ballrooms turned bazaars, writs still trade hands, mostly for rare vintages of embalming resin, ancient relics, or silks woven by handless weavers who still believe themselves living. It is said some Caravan members even wear masks while within, to avoid drawing attention from the revelers who no longer know life from performance.

The feasts of the Wraith-Kings- lavish, endless, and hollow, are more than just decadence. They are rituals of denial. The nobles of Velladorn, bound to their masked pageantry, believe (or pretend to believe) that as long as the dance continues, the kingdom endures. The sun may be dimmed, the gods gone, but Velladorn, in their minds, never fell. The guests who arrive, living or dead, are swept into the procession. Some stay. Some are never seen again.

There is a darker truth whispered beneath this veneer of undead revelry. The Wraith-Kings do not hunger, yet they require something. Some scholars of [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]] believe Velladorn sits upon a deep fissure of [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Miasma\|Miasma]], a wound where [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]]’s influence leaks most heavily. The Wraith-Kings may not just be undead nobles clinging to old rituals- they may be **anchors**, keystones in a greater curse. Their joy, their feasts, their mirthless laughter, maybe these rituals keep the rot at bay, or worse, keep it fed.

To walk into Velladorn is to step into a theater where the play never ends. Whether the Wraith-Kings know they are actors, or have forgotten altogether, is perhaps the cruelest question of all.
