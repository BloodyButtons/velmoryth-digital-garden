<center>THE GOD OF ROT'S LINGERING WILL</center>

---

It is not mist. It is not smoke. It is not fog, though to the eye it may seem a cousin to all three. It rolls with a slow and patient hunger, like breath exhaled from the lungs of a dying god. That, perhaps, is precisely what it is.

Miasma.

The term is old now, but even [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] cannot agree upon what to call it. It has been known as “the Breath of the Dead,” “Morkhalt’s Curse,” “the Final Decay.” It crept forth after the [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Anathema, The God Killer\|God-Killer]] was broken and the [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Betrayer]] sealed beneath [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]], his corpse still twitching with mockery. It is not the rot of death. It is the rot of meaning, of permanence, of life as it was once understood.

Where the Miasma pools, things unravel.

It kills, yes. That much is known. Living flesh blackens and puckers at its touch. Lungs fill with syrup-thick air. Skin blossoms with unholy lesions. But death is not the end. The Miasma rejects endings. It wakes what was meant to sleep.

I have seen farmers cough blood one night, and rise the next bearing vacant smiles, their limbs jerking in half-remembered movements. I have watched children fade, then return to their homes in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/The Hollow Marches\|The Hollow Marches]], unchanged until they blinked wrong. Spoke in voices not their own. Began to walk backwards through familiar rooms. The dead do not always return whole. Often, they are echoes, shadows of their former selves, or worse- mockeries made from grief and sinew.

But it does not only raise corpses.

The Miasma leaks into thought. Into memory. I stayed three days in a village on [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/The Silent Plains\|The Silent Plains]] and by the second, could no longer recall which building I had slept in. The people forgot my name mid-sentence. One woman buried her husband three times, not because he rose but because she kept forgetting he had died. The graves shifted. Sometimes, they sang.

It affects the land, too. [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/The Verdant Ruin\|The Verdant Ruin]] grows black-bloomed flowers where the Miasma touches root. These plants do not wither. They watch. [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/The Iron Wastes\|The Iron Wastes]] bear rusted constructs that groan in voices long lost, machines never made by mortal hands. Even magic grows erratic, glyphs scrawl themselves. Rituals backfire. [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]] grows louder.

It is airborne. But not carried by wind. It chooses. It waits. It does not flow as smoke would, but seeps into cracks, into places already dying. Old halls, abandoned temples, battlefields heavy with unspoken regret.

[[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]]s say it is the world exhaling in a death rattle, purging the remnants of divine sin. [[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]] believes it is a sign the world wants to die, and they welcome it with open mouths. The [[LORE/Mortals/Machinations\|Machinations]] study it, but even they cannot catalog what bends or breaks beneath its breath. The First Magi do not speak of it directly. Only in metaphor. Only in riddles. I suspect it haunts their dreams, same as mine.

There is no cure. Only distance. And even that does not last.

Some claim a shard of Anathema may repel it, though I’ve never seen such a thing. Others wear veil-ribbons blessed in the name of long-dead gods. These delay the rot, at best. But nothing stops it.

Because the Miasma does not consume.

It remembers.

It is the breath of a god betrayed, still whispering through the cracks of its coffin. It does not destroy what we were. It distorts it. Reflects it. Returns it in forms that should not be.

If you see the air begin to shimmer, if the wind goes still and the birds do not sing- run.

Or don’t.

You may already be taken.
