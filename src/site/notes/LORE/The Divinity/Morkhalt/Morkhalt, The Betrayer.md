![MORKHALT_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/MORKHALT_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The one who outlasted them all, Morkhalt did not seek dominion, nor balance—only the slow, inevitable truth of decay.

He is depicted as a skeletal figure draped in rotting vestments, his face a void from which whispers of the dead escape. 

He did not fall as the others did; he was betrayed and imprisoned beneath [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]] after [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]] ended. And yet, his influence seeps through the land - corrupting the earth and raising the dead in his wake.

His [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Miasma\| miasma]] spreads, twisting the living and eroding what remains. Those who listen to his whispers find themselves lost in madness, consumed by the slow, creeping inevitability of entropy.
