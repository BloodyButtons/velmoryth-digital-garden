<center>THE GOD OF KINGSHIP, LIGHT, AND MORTAL LAW</center>

------------------------------------------
![VERYN_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/VERYN_PORTRAIT.jpg)

 Veryn shone the brightest amongst his siblings. He was the ruler of the golden cities of [[LORE/Mortals/Humans\|mankind]], and the keeper of law amongst all mortals. **He was the father of civilization.** Clad in sun-forged plate bearing a halo of divine flame he and he alone led with unwavering authority, [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Lordsblade\|Lordsblade]] in hand and crown atop his head. 
 
 As [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]] unfolded his light was extinguished, and with it came the fall of order across the realms. His remnants lie in the shattered banners of fallen kingdoms and the last, rusting thrones of a bygone age. Veryn fell in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Ashen Reaches/Landmarks/Godsgrave\|Godsgrave]], now a smoldering crater of fallen divinity. 
 
 ***" Veryn, our father of order, we offer this prayer to you that you might deliver us from the madness that has befallen our people. We cry for you, O Blazing Sun. Heed our call."***
