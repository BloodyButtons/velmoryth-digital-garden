![SYLTHARIEN_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/SYLTHARIEN_PORTRAIT.jpg)

Cold, calculating, and inexorable, Syltharien sought to impose perfect order upon all things. He built the [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Eternal Lexicon\| Eternal Lexicon]], the laws that governed magic and reality, and created the Elves to keep his divine vision alive. He is depicted as a figure of silver and marble, adorned with ever-brilliant runes that shift upon his form.

When the [[LORE/Mortals/Elves\|Elves]] rebelled and shattered the Lexicon, he waged war upon them, leading to the unraveling of the world’s balance and the fraying of the fabric of reality. As his last line of defense, he created [[LORE/Mortals/Machinations\|Machinations]] and subsequently the [[LORE/Mortals/Machinations\| Soul Cages.]] 

His [[LORE/The Land/Landmarks/Impossible Tombs\|Impossible Tombs]] - once his grand libraries, are now paradox-ridden and unfathomable to the common person. Reality folds in on itself here, it is unadulterated chaos. Without the [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\| Architect]], there can be no grand design.

***"Syltharien, our grand Architect. Bestow unto us the knowledge to pursue our truest self. By your grand work, our lives perist. By your grand order, we can achieve something greater."***
