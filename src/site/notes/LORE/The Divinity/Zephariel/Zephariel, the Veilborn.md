The First God, Keeper of Time and the Eternal Cycle. 

Zephariel was the first to awaken, breaking the stillness of the Veil and creating the flow of time itself. He is depicted as a figure clad in shifting veils of shadow and light, with eyes like celestial clocks. 

It was his act of forging time that allowed the birth of the other gods, and yet he remains distant, an observer bound by his own creation.

His influence lingers in forgotten places where time flows strangely, where echoes of the past and future overlap. 

Some believe he watches still, recording the unraveling of existence, waiting for the final stroke upon his [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Golden Hourglass\|Golden Hourglass]]. The Book of Time, his divine record [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Momentus\|The Momentus]], has been lost. 

It is believed if it can be found, one might be able to rewrite time itself...
