![DHORAK_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/DHORAK_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The unyielding smith of the gods, Dhorak forged the weapons of divine war and the tools of mortal survival. 

He was depicted as a towering being of blackened steel and smoldering embers, his hands forever aflame with divine fire. His hammer, [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Emberstrike\|The Emberstrike]], rang through the heavens, shaping wonders and horrors alike. But when the gods fell, his forge grew cold, his creations left to rust and ruin.

It is said that his final, unfinished weapon still lies hidden, waiting for a hand strong enough to wield it.

Within [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/Settlements/The Crucible\|The Crucible]], his last stronghold, [[LORE/Factions/The Iron Court\|The Iron Court]] still holds faith that the [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Forgefather]] will return someday. They toil endlessly, creating wonder after wonder in hopes that He will find them worthy of his acceptance. 

***" Mountainfather, divine smith, judge us not of our ilk, but our craft. May we mend our broken bonds. We have failed you, and betrayed you. But we will make it right. We will undo this tragedy."***
