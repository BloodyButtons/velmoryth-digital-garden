Faelith was the weaver of life, the endless cycle of renewal that sustained Velmoryth.

Her touch brought the forests to bloom, rivers to flow, and beasts to roam free. She is depicted as a towering figure of vines, blossoms, and shifting petals, with eyes that glow like deep pools of verdant energy.

When [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]] shattered the divine balance, she sought to mend what was broken—but was torn apart by the conflict. Her death left nature unchecked, twisting into something neither alive nor dead, a cruel parody of the beauty she once nurtured.

Her [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]] now roam the mortal plane, motherless and dejected. In her [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/The Verdant Ruin\| Verdant Ruin]]  she rests, guarded by her last remaining children. 

***" O Blooming Mother, giver of life. May your rivers flow, and winds billow the very essence of life into our souls. We know not what the others have done. Return to us. "***
