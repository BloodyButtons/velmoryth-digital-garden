Vorrash was the fury of battle, the insatiable hunger for dominance. She created the [[LORE/Mortals/Drakes\|Drakes]] to be her warriors, leading them in endless conquest against all who opposed her. 

She is depicted as a dragon-wreathed warrior clad in jagged obsidian armor, her wings stretched wide like the banners of war.

But she was betrayed and sealed away underneath [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\|The Hungering Ridge]], her followers left leaderless, their once-glorious war reduced to scattered skirmishes and bitter survival. Her name is whispered in war cries and among those who still seek to reclaim the old glories of her dominion.

When [[LORE/The Land/Skykeep\|Skykeep]] her glorious stronghold fell from the heavens it was felt across the entire mortal plane. It was the beginning of the end. The beginning of [[LORE/Chronology/The Age of Decay\| Decay]].
