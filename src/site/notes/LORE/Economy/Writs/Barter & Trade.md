<center>THE LIFEBLOOD</center>

---

They speak of coin like it holds weight. Of stamped bone and dried flesh etched with dead decrees, passed between bleeding hands in dark alleyways and deeper shrines. [[LORE/Economy/Writs/The Last Writs\|The Last Writs]]- aye, they carry worth, but not the kind the world once knew. No more scales of silver. No more hoards of gold.

Truth is, barter rules Velmoryth. Has ever since the sun dimmed and law died choking on its own tongue.

A man doesn’t want coin when his roof leaks plague and his child cries with hollow bones. He wants meat. He wants clean cloth. He wants marrowbread that won’t sing to him while he sleeps. And so, trade returns to its oldest form, need for need. Firewood for a blade. A song for shelter. A secret for silence.

I’ve seen a man sell a memory to feed his hound.

That’s not poetry. That’s just a Tuesday.

But the Writs… oh, the Writs. They don’t buy love or loyalty, but they buy power. Passage. Blood services. They open doors too heavy to lift with hunger alone. They’re the only thing [[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\|The Ragged Caravan]] accepts in trade between factions. [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Shattered Coast/Settlements/The Den\|The Den]] won’t deal with [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Ashen Reaches/Settlements/Lasthearth\|Lasthearth]], but the Caravan will so long as the Writs flow. [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/Settlements/The Crucible\|The Crucible]] sends blackened iron south. [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/Settlements/Gloamsrest\|Gloamsrest]] offers dustless silk. The Flesh Merchants keep count and cut marks when need be, and the blood still flows warm in their ledgers.

You want to cross [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/The Silent Plains\|The Silent Plains]] with your wares intact? You pay in Writs.

You want a bound blade from a smith who still remembers [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]]’s hymn? Writs.

But outside those high deals, away from the Pact-Carts and under the sunless sky, it's the hollow market that reigns. A broken knight offers the last blessing of a god that never lived in exchange for a horse with one good leg. A [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]] gives a dream-spore to a grieving mother who hasn’t wept in years. A page from a book no one can read buys a night without screams.

It ain’t always fair. It ain’t always honest. But it’s human, in that mad, clawing way we still pretend matters.

Barter is the blood. Writs are the bones. One without the other? The body dies.

So trade wisely, friend. And keep something hidden in your sleeve. Writs can be stolen. Flesh can rot.

But need?

Need never fades.
