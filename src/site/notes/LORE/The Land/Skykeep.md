<center>THE DRAKE QUEEN'S FOLLY![[]]</center>

---

They still look to the sky, some of them, the [[LORE/Mortals/Drakes\|Drakes]] that remain, the shattered kin of fire and wing. They stare with hollow eyes, their scaled faces tilted to the heavens, as if waiting for the city to return. But it will not. Skykeep is no more.

There was a time distant, yes, but not forgotten, when the city hung above the world like a challenge, like a flame that dared the wind to snuff it out. Wreathed in cloud and crowned in crimson banners, it hovered at the edge of heaven, borne aloft by columns of burning air and wings of molten brass. Here the drakeclans gathered, once each cycle of the moons, to pay tribute in blood to [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash]], the Hungering Queen.

To walk its blackstone halls was to breathe ambition. It was carved from obsidian bone, veined with magma veins and inlaid with the melted sigils of every conquered dominion. Its arenas were etched into the hearts of its towers, each a forge of glory. There, kin fought kin- spear to fang, claw to blade under the watching flame of their goddess. The victor’s roar would ring through the city, and with it came ascent. To the highest spire, to the Queen’s gaze. To greatness.

But such glory was not meant to last.

When the first fires of [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]] began to blaze, Skykeep, so proud, so untouchable was chosen. Not by its people. Not even by Vorrash. But by all gods, who saw it as a place to settle their differences away from the eyes of most mortals. And still, the heavens ran red.

[[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]] arrived first with his brother [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn]] in tow. The others followed, [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]] with his molten hammer, [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]] wrapped in vines that hung like chains, and at last [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]], seeping rot into the clouds. [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash]] met them not in council, but in war. Her wings unfurled, her voice like fire and thunder. She did not bow.

What happened next is debated still. Some claim the Queen was betrayed by the others, sealed mid-flight by decree and blade. Others believe she turned on her own kin, mad with the hunger that had so long defined her. But this much is known: Skykeep burned, and the Drake Queen was cast deep beneath [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\|The Hungering Ridge]] in eternal slumber, in death.

Towers shattered like brittle bones. The central arena split in two, sending its champions tumbling like ash upon the wind. The sky turned black, the clouds screamed, and the city fell in silence. From that high seat, it plunged, flaming, through the tapestry of the world. Its ruin left craters, scar-troughs that never healed. Some shards embedded into the [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/The Silent Plains\|The Silent Plains]]. Others rest beneath the waves near [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]], their magma long cooled. One is said to have pierced [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/The Verdant Ruin\|The Verdant Ruin]] itself, choking the forest with scorched stone.

None speak of reclaiming it.

The drakes, what few remain, are scattered. Some hunt in packs across [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/The Iron Wastes\|The Iron Wastes]], half-feral, clinging to glory through tooth and flame. Others hide in caves, guarding molten altars to a queen who never rose again. Some whisper Vorrash was not slain, only sealed, buried beneath the very ruins of Skykeep in a prison of hunger unmet.

But I was there.

I remember the scent of scorched sky. The way the flames reached upward, not downward. I remember the Queen’s final cry, not of war, but of sorrow. Skykeep was not destroyed by gods.

It was consumed by what they had become.

And now it rests in pieces. The city in the sky. A wound in the memory of flame.

No throne rises to meet it. No glory remains.
Only ash, and ruin, and the silence of wings that will never beat again.
