![SIREN'S WATCH_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/SIREN'S%20WATCH_PORTRAIT.jpg)

Perched upon the edge of a crumbling bluff, battered ceaselessly by howling winds and crashing waves, stands Siren’s Watch. It is a ruined lighthouse of blackened stone and rusted iron, its shattered beacon looming like the hollow eye socket of a skull. Though its fire was extinguished long ago, on certain nights, a pale, spectral light flickers from its broken tower, luring ships toward unseen reefs and certain doom.

The lighthouse was once a vital beacon for the sailors of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Valndir\|Valndir]], guiding them safely past the treacherous waters of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Shattered Coast/The Shattered Coast\|The Shattered Coast]]. But in the wake of the gods' fall, something cursed the tower. Its keepers vanished, its walls cracked, and the air around it grew thick with sorrow. Now, it stands as a ruin, a place of lingering grief and malevolent whispers.

Those who draw too near are inexplicably attracted to its light, mournful and impossibly beautiful. It creeps into the mind like a lover’s whisper, calling for the lost, the grieving, and the desperate. Sailors who listen too long find themselves walking toward the sea in a trance, arms outstretched, wading into the waves until the tide pulls them under.

The few survivors speak of a figure glimpsed within the tower’s upper chamber, a woman clad in tattered silks, her face veiled, her voice carrying across the wind. Some believe she is the last lighthouse keeper, long dead but bound to the Watch, still awaiting the return of a lover who never reached shore. Others whisper darker tales- that she is no mortal ghost, but an ancient siren, using the ruins as her lair, her song a net cast for lost souls.

The air around it carries a heavy sorrow. Lanterns left at its base burn out within moments. Prayers whispered upon its steps go unanswered. Footsteps echo where no one walks. The lighthouse is partially collapsed, its foundation cracked, its stairways treacherous with time-worn stone. Inside, time feels wrong. Light bends strangely in the dust-laden air, and sounds echo longer than they should.

Beneath the Watch, hidden by collapsed stone, a flooded chamber houses something far older than the lighthouse itself. The walls are inscribed with ancient warnings, and the bones of past victims rest in the shallows. Those who uncover this place often hear a second voice beneath the waves, colder, hungrier, waiting.
