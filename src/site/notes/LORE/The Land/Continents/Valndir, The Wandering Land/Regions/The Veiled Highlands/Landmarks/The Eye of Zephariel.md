<center>THE MOURNFUL GAZE OF AN ABSENT GOD</center>

![THE EYE_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/THE%20EYE_PORTRAIT.jpg)

Crowning the highest summit of the Veiled Highlands, eternally shrouded by the luminous mist, lies The Eye of [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel]], a crumbling observatory crowned by its iconic brass dome of shattered glass. Once revered by mortal scholars and priests as a place of divine revelation, it is now a ruin standing solemnly beneath an endless, storm-choked sky, its rusted brass instruments and fractured lenses reflecting distant starlight that no mortal sky has ever known.

The observatory, named after Zephariel, the Veilborn God of Time, was originally constructed to pierce the Veil and observe the currents of time itself. Through its mighty dome of polished brass and crystalline glass- now irreparably shattered, priests and astronomers sought visions of futures and pasts glimpsing timelines branching infinitely across eternity. But in the gods’ absence, the Eye fell silent, abandoned as its custodians fled or vanished into the mists of the Veiled Highlands.

Today it stands like a silent sentinel upon the peak, a monument to the gods’ fallen ambition and mortal folly. Yet, despite its apparent abandonment, the observatory is anything but lifeless. Travelers approaching the peak describe whispers carried on cold winds, fragmented murmurs about futures that never happened and pasts that never were. Within its shadowed chambers, time itself warps and bends. Hours pass like heartbeats, days vanish into mere moments, and centuries can feel no longer than a breath.

At its core, beneath the observatory’s great brass dome now shattered and open to the sky, lies a central chamber called The Oculus. This room holds an immense crystalline lens, a fractured fragment of the Veil itself hovering impossibly in midair. The lens shimmers gently, refracting ghostly images of worlds that might have been or may yet be. To gaze through it invites revelation or madness, often both. Those brave enough to peer into its depths see events from their own past, lives unlived, or futures lost, possibilities they must either reject or desperately try to bring about.

Rumors persist among scholars and adventurers that Zephariel’s Eye safeguards artifacts of immense power, remnants of Zephariel’s own essence like [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Momentus\|The Momentus]] or a certain [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Golden Hourglass\|Golden Hourglass]].

Some believe these artifacts still rest within, locked away in hidden chambers sealed by rituals that only the god himself knew. Others argue they are mere legends, hopeful fabrications born of desperation in an unraveling world. Yet, the whispers in the mist speak otherwise, hinting that Zephariel left these treasures intentionally as either a cruel test or a final act of divine compassion toward mortals now left to suffer their own mistakes.

When Zephariel abandoned Velmoryth after the disastrous [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\| War of Hubris]], his departure fractured not just time, but the very foundations of reality itself. With the god's retreat the Eye shattered from within, its brass dome cracking violently, instruments exploding, and lenses rupturing- an event recorded by [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] at [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Settlements/Eldermere Sanctuary\|Eldermere Sanctuary]] as “The Hour of Broken Glass.” Reality around the observatory frayed, creating temporal rifts that trapped many of its scholars forever between one moment and the next, rendering them echoes trapped in loops of eternal despair.

Yet Zephariel’s Eye persists, a mournful gaze turned eternally skyward, watching over the ruins of a world once touched by divine hands. The few pilgrims who still climb to this sacred ruin whisper desperate prayers beneath its broken dome, hoping that Zephariel might one day return, or that the artifacts left behind might offer answers to Velmoryth’s crises- perhaps even restore order to a world on the edge of oblivion.

In truth, no mortal knows for certain what lies hidden within the observatory’s heart, whether salvation, damnation, or something beyond both. It remains, like Zephariel himself, an unanswered question: a silent promise, a warning, and perhaps a final chance at redemption.
