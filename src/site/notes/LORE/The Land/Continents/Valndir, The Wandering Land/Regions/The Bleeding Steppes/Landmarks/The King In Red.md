![KING_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/KING_PORTRAIT.jpg)

Rising from the crimson-dusted plateaus of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Bleeding Steppes/The Bleeding Steppes\|The Bleeding Steppes]], the King in Red stands as both a monument and a silent executioner. A towering figure of rusted iron and petrified bone, it looms over the land, its surface stained deep red from centuries of sacrifice. Some say the Colossus was once a king who sought to claim godhood, cursed to stand as a sentinel over the very gate he hoped to control. Others whisper that it is not a statue at all, but a warrior frozen in time, waiting for a soul strong enough to awaken it. At his feet lies the entrance to the Veins, a vast network of ancient tunnels and caverns, now used by [[LORE/Factions/The Blooded Covenant\|The Blooded Covenant]] for their most profane rites. To pass through, warriors must first kneel before the colossal figure, slashing their palms upon the rusted stone as an offering. If he deems them worthy, the entrance will open. If not, the air grows heavy with the weight of unseen judgment, and those unworthy are swallowed by the land itself, never to be seen again.
