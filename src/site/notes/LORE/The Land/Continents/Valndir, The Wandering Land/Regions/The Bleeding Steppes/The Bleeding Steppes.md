The Bleeding Steppes stretch across the western coast of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Valndir\|Valndir]], a land of arid plateaus, deep ravines, and scattered war-torn relics, where the very earth seems to thirst for blood. The terrain is rugged and broken, cut by winding canyons and cracked riverbeds, long since drained of their original waters. Instead, iron-rich dust and scarlet-tinged soil stain the land, giving it its infamous name. 

A vast network of deep canyons where the wind howls like a dying beast sprawl endlessly across the region. These ravines are believed to be the remnants of ancient rivers, now choked with rust-colored sand and the remnants of past wars. Bone shrines and abandoned siege engines litter the depths, marking places of forgotten massacres. Atop them, towering rock formations that resemble the jagged remains of colossal swords, half-buried in the land. Some claim these are the weapons of fallen titans, shattered and discarded in some forgotten battle. [[LORE/Factions/The Blooded Covenant\|The Blooded Covenant]] use these peaks as altars, where warriors prove their worth through duels to the death. 

Below the canyons lies a stretch of land where nothing grows, its surface covered in jagged white salt formations. The Covenant believes this is a cursed battlefield, a place where warriors fought until only dust remained. The ground is littered with the bones of those who refused to die, left to bleach beneath a sky that has long since forgotten their names. At its center, a statue of a forgotten king stands stoically, stained red with the offerings of those who wish to claim his legacy. Some claim its eyes watch the steppes, waiting for one worthy to take its place. This [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Bleeding Steppes/Landmarks/The King In Red\|Red King]] guards and entrance at its feet, but to where this entrance leads is unknown.
