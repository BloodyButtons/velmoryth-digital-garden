Stretching along [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Valndir\|Valndir]]’s southern edge, the Shattered Coast is a fractured shoreline where jagged cliffs plunge sharply into tempestuous seas. The land itself seems to have splintered and fractured, as if broken by the hand of some ancient titan. Vast, sea-carved chasms crisscross the landscape, forming labyrinthine canyons filled with seawater, fog, and whispered echoes of drowned souls.

The sky here is perpetually storm-choked, with rolling thunderclouds releasing torrents of rain that beat relentlessly upon blackened stone and ruined fortifications. Shipwrecks, old and new, litter the shore, their skeletal remains half-buried in sand or smashed upon sharp rocks, serving as grim monuments to the perilous tides and lurking horrors beneath the waves. The undead that rise from them find themselves in a perpetual state of rot, sea-soaked flesh sloughing off in droves.

The Shattered Coast has always been a place of exile, refuge, and desperation. Scattered throughout this treacherous region are settlements of outcasts and rogues, pirates, scavengers, and mystics who have nowhere else to go. Life here is harsh, driven by necessity and brutal pragmatism. But despite its grim reputation, the Shattered Coast harbors secrets, forgotten treasures, and whispered promises of redemption- or damnation.

Somewhere along the coast unknown to the majority lies [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Shattered Coast/Settlements/The Den\|The Den]], a cesspit of the most lawless people from across Velmoryth. It is ruled by [[LORE/Factions/The Warlords of The Den\| Warlords]] , and is in a constant power struggle with [[LORE/Factions/The Lasthearth Tribunal\|The Lasthearth Tribunal]].  Looking over the farthest reach lies [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Shattered Coast/Landmarks/Siren's Watch\|Siren's Watch]], an unmistakable reminder of the cursed shores that many make their living- if you can call it that.
