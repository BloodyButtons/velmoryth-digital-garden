High above the broken kingdoms and festering dominions of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Valndir\|Valndir]] rise the Veiled Highlands, a land perpetually cloaked in an unnatural mist that shifts like pale silk, obscuring peaks and valleys alike. These mountains were once revered as holy ground, sanctified to [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel]], the Veilborn God of Time. In ancient days, priests and scholars ascended these heights to meditate and divine the future from Zephariel’s whispers. Now, those days are but echoes lost to the mist, and the Veiled Highlands stand as eerie monuments to a past neither fully forgotten nor remembered clearly.

The mist that cloaks this region is no mere vapor; it is a shadow of the Veil itself, lingering as reality begins to fray in the wake of the death of gods. It weaves through the land like spectral silk, never fully lifting, perpetually shrouding cliffs, paths, and ancient ruins. It blurs distances, confounds direction, and twists perception until one can no longer trust their senses. Travelers who ascend the mountains claim that voices from their past whisper out of the fog, speaking truths that no one else could know. Others claim visions of impossible futures or alternate pasts, glimpsed briefly through fleeting openings in the mist.

Yet despite this oppressive strangeness- or perhaps because of it, the Veiled Highlands are not wholly abandoned. At the heart of the region lies the ancient [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Settlements/Eldermere Sanctuary\|Eldermere Sanctuary]], home to the enigmatic [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]]. These sorcerers, descendants of those who shattered [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Eternal Lexicon\|The Eternal Lexicon]] of [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]] and unleashed magic upon Velmoryth, cling desperately to the knowledge stolen long ago. Their numbers have dwindled to a mere handful, isolated in their crumbling sanctuary of obsidian spires, labyrinthine libraries, and mirrored halls that endlessly reflect both memory and madness.

 It is here that the Magi maintain their tireless vigil, pouring through ancient tomes whose pages rewrite themselves each dawn, their contents shifting with every glance. They labor day and night, performing arcane rites in an effort to halt the decay of Velmoryth or perhaps even restore some fragment of the world's lost order. But magic, never meant for mortal hands, exacts a terrible price, slowly consuming their memories, their bodies, and their souls.

Towards the coastline lies a ruined observatory, [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Landmarks/The Eye of Zephariel\|The Eye of Zephariel]], a relic of ancient times. A great dome of tarnished brass and shattered glass, its instruments frozen mid-motion, still occasionally pulse softly with the dying heartbeat of the Veil. Gazing into the great cracked lenses here, a traveler sees impossible visions—events yet to occur or things best left unknown.
