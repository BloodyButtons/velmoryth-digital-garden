![ASCENT_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/ASCENT_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The Forsaken Ascent is not a city, it is a battlefield in constant motion, a shifting crucible where only the strongest endure. Nestled within the cracked expanse of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Bleeding Steppes/The Bleeding Steppes\|The Bleeding Steppes]], it stretches outward from The Red Spiral, a spiraling, open-air arena carved into a sunken canyon where warriors fight their way up its bloodstained walls to claim dominion over [[LORE/Factions/The Blooded Covenant\|The Blooded Covenant]]. To falter is to fall, and the depths of the canyon are lined with the bones of those who failed. 


Surrounding this brutal trial ground is a sprawling, ever-changing encampment known as The Carrion Wastes, where warbands gather in a chaotic mass of bloodstained tents, crude altars, and makeshift arenas, each warleader marking their claim with tattered banners until another takes it by force. The air is thick with the scent of iron, and the ground never dries, soaked with the lifeblood of warriors who live and die by the blade. At the edge of the Sprawl lies The Sacrificial Maw , a vast sinkhole serving as a sort of barrier to the wider region. 

From all across Velmoryth, warriors march in the Procession of the Worthy, a ceaseless pilgrimage of aspirants, war-thralls, and desperate souls seeking to carve their names into history. Those who survive the march are granted a weapon and a chance to prove themselves; those who falter are left to the carrion birds or dragged to the Maw as offerings. The Ascent has no rulers, no lasting thrones- only those strong enough to claim power in the moment. Warbands rise and fall like the tides, their leaders slain as quickly as they ascend. There are no laws here, no order beyond the will of the blade. The Blooded Covenant does not seek peace, nor dominion- they seek ascension. Through endless war, sacrifice, and bloodshed, they may transcend mortality itself and claim a place among the gods.
