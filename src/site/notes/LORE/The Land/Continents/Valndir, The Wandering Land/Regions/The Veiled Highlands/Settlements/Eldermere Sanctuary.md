Atop one of the towering plateaus of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/The Veiled Highlands\|The Veiled Highlands]], shrouded in luminous, shifting mist, stands the fortress-monastery of Eldermere Sanctuary. Hewn from dark stone that gleams faintly with reflected starlight, its spires and towers pierce the veil of fog like shadowed sentinels guarding secrets older than memory itself.

Eldermere is known by few, and fewer still ever reach it. Surrounded on all sides by steep cliffs and perilous drops into mist-filled valleys, its only access points are ancient, weathered wooden bridges- precarious pathways swinging gently above endless emptiness, creaking underfoot like the whispers of ghosts. Those bridges form the sole tenuous connection to the wider world, deliberately fragile, easily severed should danger approach.

Within Eldermere’s walls dwell the reclusive and enigmatic [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\| First Magi]], descendants of the earliest sorcerers who first defied [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]]’s decree, stealing magic from the god’s [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Eternal Lexicon\| Eternal Lexicon]]. Cloaked in faded robes of silk embroidered with forgotten symbols, they roam mirrored halls whose reflections never quite match reality, libraries stacked impossibly high with tomes whose texts shift endlessly, and workshops filled with arcane devices, rusted brass instruments, and cracked lenses through which they gaze into the fractured timelines beyond. 

In this place the last true magical practitioners of Velmoryth toil relentlessly, searching for an answer to [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]]'s [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Miasma\|Miasma]], and the ever-creeping presence of [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]].

At night, [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/The Harrow\|The Harrow]] haunt the valleys below, looking for a way into the fort-home of their last true adversaries.
