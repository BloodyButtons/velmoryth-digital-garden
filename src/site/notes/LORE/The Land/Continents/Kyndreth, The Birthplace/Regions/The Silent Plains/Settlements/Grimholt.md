Amid the ashen grasses and the endless fog of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/The Silent Plains\|The Silent Plains]], there stands Grimholt, an ancient monastic stronghold of blackened stone with its towers lost in the mist. This is the home of [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]], a solemn and spectral order that guards the bones of the dead gods that try to preserve what little remains of the shattered divinity.

Within these dark halls, tomb-priests chant hymns in voiceless reverence, their prayers spoken not in sound, but in thought and gesture. They adorn themselves in tattered ceremonial robes, woven with gold-threaded dirges, their eyes hollowed by years spent walking between the realms of the living and the dead.

Beneath Grimholt, vast catacombs stretch deep into the cold, silent earthen vaults of forgotten relics and the remains of those who once held the world together. Here lie the skulls of nameless gods, great shattered tablets inscribed with the last words of a fallen pantheon, and crypts filled with the dust of empires long faded to nothing.

Though the Silent Plains offer no warbands nor raiders something lurks beyond the fog, watching Grimholt with unseen eyes. Some say the silence is not a gift, but a warning. The Dirge-Bearers keep their watch, standing sentinel over madness masquerading as tranquility.
