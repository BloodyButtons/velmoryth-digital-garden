<center>THE ENDLESS PROCESSION</center>

![MARCHES_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/MARCHES_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The **Hollow Marches** are not merely a land, they are a procession without end, a graveyard with no boundaries. Here the sky is perpetually shrouded in a heavy gray pall, as if mourning the souls that wander below. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, of rot and ash, and the distant sound of dirges carries through the wind like whispers from the dead.

No living man walks the Marches alone. Whether knight or beggar, king or serf, all who tread this forsaken stretch of land will in time find themselves among **the Procession**, the ceaseless line of the dead marching toward graves that do not exist.

Those who stand in their way do not last long. To disrupt the march is to invite **the Hollowing**, the slow, inevitable unraveling of one’s very soul. Many an unfortunate traveler has joined their ranks without even realizing it, their footsteps falling into rhythm, their mind slipping away into the long and mournful tide of the dead.

At the heart of **The Hollow Marches**, where the funeral processions never cease and the dead outnumber the living, stands **[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/Settlements/Velladorn, The Squalored Throne\|Velladorn, the Squalored Throne]]**. Once the **proud capital of a vast empire**, its streets now rot beneath the weight of its own delusions. The nobles who remain here do not acknowledge the world’s decay. They dress in tattered finery, hold endless feasts at empty tables, and dance through crumbling halls in masquerades of **denial and madness**.

Somewhere along the Marches is [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/Landmarks/The Broken Sepulcher\|The Broken Sepulcher]], a place where The Procession coalesces into a myriad of rotting flesh. They grow denser and more frenzied here yet none seem to know why. Those who have entered, be them [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\| Dirge-Bearers]], [[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\| Ragged Caravan]], or [[The Flesh Merchants\| Flesh Merchants]], do not return.
