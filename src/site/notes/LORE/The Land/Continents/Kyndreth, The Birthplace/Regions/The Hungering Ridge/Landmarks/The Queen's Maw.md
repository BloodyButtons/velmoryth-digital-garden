<center>THE GRAVE OF VORRASH</center>

![MAW_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/MAW_PORTRAIT.jpg)

A gaping chasm of molten fury, the Queen's Maw is the wound left behind when [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash]] was sealed away. It is a vast and ever-burning fissure that burns deep below [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\|The Hungering Ridge]], its walls lined with jagged obsidian and veins of searing magma. The air is thick with heat, rippling like a mirage, and the ground trembles as if something vast and insatiable still stirs beneath.

It is said that Vorrash’s rage still echoes from the depths, a low, guttural growl that can be heard when the wind dies. The Maw is both a prison and a promise - a reminder that a god’s hunger can never be truly silenced.

Few dare venture close. The [[LORE/Mortals/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] of [[LORE/Factions/The Iron Court\|The Iron Court]] have spent centuries ensuring that whatever lies beneath does not rise again. Massive chains, each link the size of a warhorse, are anchored to the surrounding cliffs. Iron Priests of flame-warding carve sigils into the rock, while warriors keep a silent vigil, knowing that if the Maw ever opens fully that the world will burn in furious rage.

Legends speak of Ashen Wyrms, remnants of Vorrash’s brood, slithering through the crevices, whispering to those who dream too deeply of fire and conquest. Zealots who seek to awaken their queen, leave blood offerings at the edge, hoping to stir her from her endless slumber.

None know if she truly sleeps, if she watches, or if she simply lies in death beneath the molten strata. But surely, if she watches or if she sleeps, the Hunger is waiting for the moment when the last of her chains finally shatter.
