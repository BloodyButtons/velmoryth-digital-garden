![REMNANT_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/REMNANT_PORTRAIT.jpg)
The remains of [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith, The Blooming Mother]], lie at the heart of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/The Verdant Ruin\|The Verdant Ruin]], a colossal, petrified form partially entwined with the roots of an impossible forest. Her body, twisted in eternal repose, is neither fully stone nor fully plant - her bones are latticed with vines, her flesh is a husk from which fungi bloom, and her final breath still lingers in the air, giving birth to unceasing, unchecked life. Over countless ages, it is barely recognizable to an outsider as her corpse, yet there it lay, molded into the very earth.

Deep within her ribcage, an enormous cavern pulses with luminescent fungal growth. The [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]] claim this is the last living echo of Faelith, a sacred place where her memories still bloom like spores in the air.

The Womb of Thorns exists as a tangled mass of briars and vine-wrapped bone, once believed to be the cradle of new life, but now overgrown to the point of hostility. [[LORE/Factions/Faelith's Rotguard\|Faelith's Rotguard]] patrol its edges, ensuring that whatever stirs within does not awaken.

Her petrified fingers stretch skyward like massive, bleached branches. Strange flowers bloom from their tips, carrying seeds said to be remnants of the goddess’s lost thoughts. Those who consume them experience visions of a world that never was.

What should have been her grave, where her body should have turned to dust, instead became a place of grotesque vitality. Roots churn through her remains, swallowing the land whole, birthing abominations of plant and flesh. The deeper one delves, the more the roots seem to resemble veins, pulsing with an eerie, unnatural rhythm.

To the Mycari, her corpse is a place of both worship and sorrow. The Rotguard watch over her body, protecting it from scavengers, scholars, and desperate fools who think they can siphon what is left of her power. Some believe that she still dreams, her last will taking form through the rampant growth of the Verdant Ruin. Others fear that she is not resting at all, but waiting.
