<center>THE REFLECTION OF A DEAD WORLD</center>

The Mirror stretches like an ocean of fractured glass, a land where the sky is mirrored beneath your feet, and each step carries the weight of uncertainty. It is known to be somewhere within [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Wound of The Earth/The Wound Of The Earth\|The Wound Of The Earth]], but there are many different accounts of its true location. Many say that perhaps it shifts at random, never appearing in the same place twice. This is a place where reality fractures and reforms without logic, where time loops upon itself, and where reflections act of their own accord. [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]]'s presence is the strongest here out of anywhere else in the world. 

The surface of the land is smooth as polished obsidian, but it does not always reflect what is real. Travelers look down and see themselves as they were years ago, or as they will be in death. The sky sometimes stretches endlessly in a mirrored expanse, giving the illusion of walking on air, while at other times, the reflections show landscapes and figures that should not exist.

To linger here is to risk losing oneself to the Choir. It is rumored to be what will become of Velmoryth should it fully manifest, a hollow expanse devoid of life, devoid of time, devoid of *concept*. It is everlasting, unnatural stillness.

The [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/Mirror-Dwellers\|Mirror-Dwellers]] are rampant, First, they steal reflections, then names, then presence itself. Over time, the person whose reflection they claim begins to fade, their shadow thinning, their voice growing distant, until they are simply gone.
People in conversation will be suddenly met with blank stares as if they never existed. Slowly unraveling into a maddening cacophony, the more they try to remind someone the faster they are replaced, or fade into nothing entirely. 

[[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/Mawlights\|Mawlights]] appear in flickers across the black glass,  threatening to disintegrate their observers into feverish nonexistence. 

[[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/Shatterwraiths\|Shatterwraiths]] float across the emptiness turning travelers into shadows of their former existence.

It is riddled with [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/The Harrow\|The Harrow]], the very land itself a foul omen of what future The Choir may bring to Velmoryth.

Somewhere along the glass, The Thousandfold Gate sprawls like a fractured dream across the reflective expanse of the Mirror, an immense circular labyrinth of broken mirrored arches stretching endlessly on the seamless plane of blackened glass. Each archway reflects warped glimpses of a sky forever veiled in storms, whispering fragmented truths and half-seen visions to those who dare wander the labyrinth. Travelers speak in hushed tones of their reflections acting on their own accord, shadowy movements defying logic, and entities glimpsed in the mirrored surfaces- beings whose forms twist comprehension, birthed from nightmares older than mortal memory.

At the labyrinth’s center, obscured by dense, otherworldly fog, lies a secret more ancient than even the fallen gods. Legends suggest that the Thousandfold Gate is not merely architecture, but a tear in reality itself, a portal where the fabric separating worlds has frayed thin. Some speculate the center hides a portal to realms beyond mortal reckoning, perhaps where the Choir first entered Velmoryth's plane of existence.

Yet all agree on one truth: the Gate is watched. Neither living nor dead, this observer dwells silently at the labyrinth’s heart. Few who glimpse its silhouette through the fog retain their sanity, and fewer still return.
