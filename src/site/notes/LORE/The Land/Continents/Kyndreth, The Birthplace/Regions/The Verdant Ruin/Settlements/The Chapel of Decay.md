Deep within [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/The Verdant Ruin\| The Ruin]], where colossal roots twist through shattered temples and the land itself pulses with unnatural life, lies The Chapel of Decay. This is the last great gathering place of the [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]], the fungal descendants of [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]].

The Chapel is not built in the manner of mortal cities; it is grown. Towering mushroom spires sprout from the ruins of an ancient elven citadel, their caps forming great canopies that shield the settlement from the sky’s dim and fading light. Walls of interwoven roots and fungal stalks pulse faintly, as if the city itself is breathing.

The air is thick with a golden mist of spores, drifting lazily in the damp twilight, and the streets- if they can be called such, are a tangled maze of vines, bioluminescent fungi, and petrified wooden bridges spanning deep pools of phosphorescent water.

At the heart of the Blooming Bastion stands the Great Spore-Tree, an ancient petrified remnant of Faelith’s influence, its bark riddled with pulsating mycelium veins. The Mycari claim that through it, they still hear whispers of the Blooming Mother, though whether these are memories or something more alive remains unknown.

The largest and most organized Mycari faction, [[LORE/Factions/Faelith's Rotguard\|Faelith's Rotguard]], makes its home here. Unlike their scattered, feral kin who wander the Ruin, these Mycari have purpose - they are warriors, caretakers, and keepers of Faelith’s final will.
