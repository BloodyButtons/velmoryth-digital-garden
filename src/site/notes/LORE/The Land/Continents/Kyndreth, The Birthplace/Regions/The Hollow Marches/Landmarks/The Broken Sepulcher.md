![SEPULCHER_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/SEPULCHER_PORTRAIT.jpg)
The Broken Sepulcher is a monolithic forsaken fortress buried deep within [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/The Hollow Marches\|The Hollow Marches]], standing as a relic of a bygone age when the gods still cast their decrees upon the world. Once a grand citadel of [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn]]'s subjects, it has since become a prison of silent wraiths, restless dead, and decaying oaths.

The fortress itself is a gargantuan, black-stone bastion, its walls slick with ceaseless rain and the soot of funeral pyres long extinguished. No banners fly, for there are none left to raise them, only the ashen remains of old standards, clinging stubbornly to their poles like forgotten ghosts.

The halls are lined with sealed tombs, where the greatest of knights and judges were once entombed, many of whom still walk as solemn spirits in rusted armor, their duty too ingrained to release even in death.

It is said that any who step beyond the Sepulcher’s gates are judged, not by a living court, but by the very walls themselves. Echoes of forgotten trials ring through the halls, passing verdicts upon those who enter. Some say the fortress remembers crimes never committed, and judges even the innocent for the sins of those long past.
