<center>THE DWARVES' LAST STAND</center>

![CRUCIBLE_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/CRUCIBLE_PORTRAIT.jpg)

Once, the [[LORE/Mortals/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] were master smiths of [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]]’s grand forges, but with his fall, they were left leaderless, wandering and fractured. Many fell into despair, but some, believing that the Forgebearer’s last embers could still be rekindled, gathered in the heart of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\|The Hungering Ridge]], carving out a new home within the mountains. This place became [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/Settlements/The Crucible\|The Crucible]], a fortress-city built within the skeletal remains of Velmoryth’s last great forge, nestled within the volcanic depths of the Ridge.

Here, the dwarves stoke the embers of the past, forging weapons that may one day be used in a final reckoning—be it against the horrors of the world, or to keep [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash]] entombed for eternity. They mine the cursed mountains, drawing forth metals touched by the lingering presence of Vorrash, forging weapons and armor imbued with the ravenous hunger of the Ridge itself.

Yet, there are whispers…
Some claim that the Crucible guards something far more valuable than weapons, that deep below the city, beneath layers of rock and rune, Vorrash’s slumbering form remains. It is said that the dwarves do not only fear her awakening, but some among them desire it. That one day, they might unleash her upon the world once more, wielding the Drake Queen as the ultimate weapon to reshape Velmoryth.

For now, the Crucible remains a fortress of fire, steel, and defiance, but in the shadows of its molten halls, the flames of ambition flicker ever dangerously close to madness.
