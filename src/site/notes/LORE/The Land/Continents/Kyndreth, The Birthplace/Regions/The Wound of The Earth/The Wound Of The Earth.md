There is no place in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Kyndreth\|Kyndreth]], or anywhere in Velmoryth, that bears deeper scars than the Wound of the Earth. It is not merely a battlefield, nor even a ruin of divine wrath, it is an open and festering fissure, a hole in reality where the very laws that govern existence have been fractured beyond repair. It was here that the gods fought their final battle, a clash so great it unmade the world around them.

The Wound is no simple chasm - it is a place where the earth itself resists being whole again, where the sky bends downward, and the ground stretches in directions that should not be possible. Even now, long after the gods’ fall, the forces unleashed here have not settled. They continue to churn, to twist, as though the battle never truly ended.

But it was not the gods who dealt the final blow.

No, it was here that mortals seized their only chance, striking at their shattered gods when they were at their weakest, ending divinity itself. Or so they believed, for [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]] remained, his will lingering like an infection that refused to fade.

Few who enter the Wound ever return, and those who do rarely remain unchanged.

Stones float in place, rivers run upward, and those who step too close to the fissure fall into the sky rather than into the earth. The land itself rejects the notion of stability, as if the rules of existence unravel the further one walks into the depths.

 A traveler may walk into the Wound only to emerge moments later, aged decades, their memories twisted, their past rewritten. Others may remain frozen in a single second, unable to move forward in time, trapped as mere echoes of themselves. Some wander through the Wound and claim to see the gods still fighting, still waging their final war, forever locked in that fateful moment.

 The corpses of those who died in the Wound do not rot. They do not rise. They simply… exist, as if caught in a world that refuses to let them go. Some whisper that they are trapped between moments, forever repeating their final gasps, their last thoughts, never quite alive, never quite dead.

There is no place in Velmoryth where [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]]’s presence is stronger than in the Wound. Their song reverberates through the fractured sky, an endless lament that warps the mind and body alike. Here, the song is no mere whisper—it is a storm, a tide, a force that drags all who listen into its embrace.

 The Harrow roam here more freely than anywhere else - beings of impossible form, things that should not be, that cannot be, yet are. Some are little more than glimpses of something wrong, lurking in the edge of vision, others are vast, formless things that twist the land beneath them as they move, leaving only ruinous afterimages in their wake.

And yet, for all the madness that writhes in the Wound, one place remains untouched.

[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Wound of The Earth/Settlements/The Black Hollow\|The Black Hollow]], the fortress of [[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]], stands at the edge of the abyss, unshaken, untouched, unclaimed.
