A vast and desolate stretch of fields, the Silent Plains are unlike any other place in Velmoryth. Here an eerie and unnatural stillness blankets the land, smothering all sound in a deafening hush. Even the wind dares not stir, and the sky is choked in an endless viscous fog that clings to the earth like an unbroken shroud.

For reasons unknown, [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]]’s song does not reach this place, nor do [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/The Harrow\|The Harrow]]. The silence is absolute, an oppressive force that allows nothing to invade its serenity. And yet those that find themselves here, save for [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]], find themselves trapped. Their minds fog, their wills dull, doomed to roam the fields forever. It is something wholly unnatural that watches over this place, and none can say for sure what it is. But whatever it may be, it does not let many leave. 

Scattered across the Silent Plains are thousands of nameless graves, marked only by unadorned stones - monuments to the dead who were never mourned. Unlike elsewhere in Velmoryth, no spirits rise here, no wraiths linger, and no restless corpses claw from their burial mounds. It is as if something in the silence holds them fast, preventing them from returning as the dead so often do.

[[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]] claim that the bones of gods are buried beneath this soil, and that the silence is the last mercy granted to those who have perished. Others fear that something older than even the gods watches from the mist, keeping all sound at bay.

Some believe the Silent Plains were once a battlefield, where the gods themselves perished, and that their silence is the final echo of their deaths.

Others whisper that the Plains were not made silent but silenced themselves, suggesting the presence of something that devoured the Choir’s song and left nothing in its wake.
