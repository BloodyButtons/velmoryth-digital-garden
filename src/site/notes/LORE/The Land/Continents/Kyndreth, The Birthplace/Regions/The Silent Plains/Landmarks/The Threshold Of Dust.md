![THRESHOLD_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/THRESHOLD_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The Threshold of Dust stands alone in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/The Silent Plains\|The Silent Plains]], a monolithic archway of blackened stone, etched with sigils that have long since eroded into obscurity. The structure bears no clear origin, no indication of what it once belonged to, and no ruins to suggest it was ever part of something greater. It is simply there, looming against the ever-present fog. Those who dare pass beneath its yawning void do not return, their footprints trailing into nothingness, leaving only a scattering of dust in their wake.

But the truth, whispered only among the most devoted [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\| Dirge-Bearers]], is that the Threshold is not an end, but an gateway to something unseen, a place that exists just beyond the perception of mortal eyes. Those who pass through do not vanish; they descend.

Beyond the Threshold lies The Hall of Echoes, an invisible catacomb buried beneath the Silent Plains, unseen by the world above. To most, it does not exist - only those who walk the Threshold with intent, their souls burdened with purpose, may find themselves drawn into its descent.

This forgotten labyrinth is neither wholly dead nor truly alive. It is a liminal place, a tomb for those who never found rest, a prison for memories that refuse to fade. Its halls stretch endlessly in shifting configurations, worn marble corridors twisting into catacombs of nameless graves, their occupants whispering ceaselessly in voices too faint to understand.

In the deepest recesses of this dimensional anomaly lies The Nameless Gate, a towering doorway of black stone and tarnished gold, sealed by a thousand rusted chains. The Dirge-Bearers believe this to be the resting place of a forgotten god, a divine corpse lost between existence and oblivion. The threshold is inscribed with a single phrase in an unknown tongue - one that, when spoken aloud, causes the dust to shift as if in recognition. And just in front of it is the Guardian.

The Guardian stands as an eternal sentinel before the Nameless Gate, the last barrier that no mortal has ever crossed. It is a figure of imposing stature, its form draped in age-worn ceremonial armor that seems more monument than man. It exudes an unsettling timelessness, as if it has been standing in silent watch since the very [[LORE/Chronology/The Creation of Velmoryth\| creation of Velmoryth]].

No one knows what lies beyond the Nameless Gate. Some say it is the threshold to oblivion, others whisper that it leads to the slumbering remnants of divinity itself. Whatever the truth may be, the Guardian allows none to pass. It does not speak, does not move - until one dares to step forward.

Some pilgrims have tried to plead with it. Some have offered prayers, relics, even their own lives, hoping to be deemed worthy. None have succeeded. Others, less patient, have raised steel against it, only for their strikes to shatter upon its form like fragile glass. The Guardian does not fight - it corrects, ensuring that none disturb whatever rests beyond.
