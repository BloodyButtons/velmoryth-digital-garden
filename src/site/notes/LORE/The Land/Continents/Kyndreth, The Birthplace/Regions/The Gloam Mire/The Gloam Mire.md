 The Gloam Mire is a vast and treacherous expanse of tangled roots, stagnant waters, and shifting bogs where the land itself seems unwilling to be mapped. It is a place of perpetual nightfall, where the canopy of ancient trees is so thick that only slivers of waning light pierce through, casting the swamp in an eerie, half-lit gloom. The air is thick with mist and the distant glow of fungal lanterns, bioluminescent growths that pulse with a dim and sickly light. The deeper one ventures, the more the land itself seems to resist passage, swallowing paths, raising new ridges, and rerouting waterways as if the Mire is a living thing with a will of its own. Somewhere in the hostile wetland lies [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/Landmarks/The Shroudway\|The Shroudway]], an inscrutable passage that seems to change its location at random. It is rumored that should one find themselves there, and should they learn to survive inside, they may travel to and from any location across the wider world.

The Gloam Mire is not entirely uninhabited. [[LORE/Factions/The Gloamwardens\|The Gloamwardens]], an enigmatic order of guardians, tend to the swamp and its secrets, ensuring that its true horrors remain buried. What they protect, or perhaps imprison, is a mystery known only to them and the people of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/Settlements/Gloamsrest\|Gloamsrest]] - the village at the heart of the fetid wetland. The [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]] also dwell here, those few who remain untouched by madness, their fungal bodies blending seamlessly with the overgrowth.

The swamp is whispered to be alive, or at least guided by a force older than men or gods. Those who linger too long hear voices slithering between the reeds, whispering things they should not know.
