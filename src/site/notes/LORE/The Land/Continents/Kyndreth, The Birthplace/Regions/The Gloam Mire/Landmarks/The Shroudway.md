Deep within the **Gloam Mire**, where the mist never lifts and the trees stretch like grasping hands toward the sky, lies **The Shroudway**.

A hidden path known only to those whom the Mire deems worthy, it is not a road in the traditional sense; it shifts, moves, and bends, its course dictated by the will of its travelers themselves. One could walk the same stretch twice and find themselves in two entirely different places.

The Shroudway is **not marked on any map**, for maps are useless here. It is a secret, a whisper carried by the reeds and the winds that rustle through the canopy. Some say the path leads to [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/Settlements/Gloamsrest\|Gloamsrest]], the hidden village of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/The Gloam Mire\|The Gloam Mire]], but others claim it winds far deeper, beyond mortal lands, into places where the **Veil** is thinnest.

Unlike the shifting mists that veil much of the Mire, the fog along The Shroudway never disperses. It clings to travelers like a second skin, muffling sound and obscuring vision. Shapes move within the fog - some real, others perhaps mere tricks of the light. Some claim to hear **familiar voices** calling from within, luring them from the path. Few who stray ever return.

Silent figures clad in tattered robes sometimes appear along the Shroudway, walking in slow and solemn procession. They do not speak nor do they react to those who pass them by. They simply march toward **a destination no living soul knows**. [[LORE/Factions/The Gloamwardens\|The Gloamwardens]] claim these are **those who lost themselves to [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/The Gloam Mire\| the Mire]], their spirits forever walking a road that leads nowhere. 

A massive arch of twisting roots and petrified wood marks the path’s deepest point. This is the final threshold, beyond which **no mortal should tread**. The Gloamwardens refuse to speak of what lies beyond, but rumors persist of a place where **the world thins, where the sky does not meet the earth, and where something ancient waits to be released**. A towering, hollowed-out **tree shaped like a man**, stands before the Shrouded Gate. It does not move, nor does it breathe, but its **roots shift when no one is looking**.  Travelers of the Shroud have said that strange corpses litter the path here, overtaken by the very same sort of root.
