<center>A BASTION FROM INSANITY</center>

![HOLLOW_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/HOLLOW_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The Black Hollow is an unnatural void nestled within the heart of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Wound of The Earth/The Wound Of The Earth\|The Wound Of The Earth]], a place where the very fabric of reality frays and the laws of existence unravel. Yet, in the midst of this chaos, the Hollow stands untouched, a paradox in a world that defies stability.

Unlike the shifting landscapes around it, where gravity reverses and time bends, the Black Hollow remains eerily still as an immovable bastion of emptiness in a world plagued by change. Its architecture is a monolithic ruin, its walls etched with forgotten decrees, its towers reaching into a sky that does not recognize them. The structures here are made of blackened stone, seamless and cold, with no signs of age or wear, as if they were carved from the void itself.

[[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]] makes its home here, drawn to its enigmatic stillness. They claim that the Hollow is proof of their truth: that nothingness is the only constant, the only certainty in a world long abandoned by order and gods alike. They believe it was not the gods who carved this place, but something older - something that existed before the first divine word was spoken.

The Hollow is their sanctuary, their final refuge, their cathedral of oblivion. Here, they gather in solemn silence, waiting for the last remnants of Velmoryth to fade.

For reasons no scholar or sorcerer understands, [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]] nor its [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/The Harrow\| Harrow]] touch the Black Hollow. The song that permeates every corner of the world, that calls to the lost and the forsaken, falls silent within the Hollow’s walls. Some say it is because the Choir has already claimed this place that it does not sing here, because this land is already forgotten. Others whisper that something even the Choir fears dwells below, waiting in the darkness, watching.
