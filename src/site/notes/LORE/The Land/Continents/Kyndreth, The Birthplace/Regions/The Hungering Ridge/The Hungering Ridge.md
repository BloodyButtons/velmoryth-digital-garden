<center>VORRASH'S LAST STAND</center>

![RIDGE_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/RIDGE_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The Hungering Ridge is a scar upon the world, a jagged expanse of blackened mountains and yawning chasms where the land itself seems to have been gnawed upon by some unseen, insatiable force. It was here that [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash, The Hunger]], the Drake Queen, was betrayed and sealed away beneath the very rock she once ruled over. To this day the land trembles with her distant muffled roars, and the air is thick with the stench of sulfur and molten metal. The mountains shudder and some say her prison is weakening, though none dare to confirm the truth.

The land is hostile to all but the hardiest of souls. Rivers of slag and molten rock carve their way through the broken crags, and obsidian spires jut like the teeth of some colossal beast, reaching for the bloodied sky. The very ground groans with unrelenting hunger, a ceaseless pressure that drains vitality from the weak-willed.
