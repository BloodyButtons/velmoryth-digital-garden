The Verdant Ruin is not merely a forest, but an overgrown realm where nature has reclaimed all, leaving behind only faint echoes of what once was. It is a place where [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]]’s will lingers, though twisted and broken, where growth is endless, unchecked, and in some cases, unnatural. Trees rise from the remains of great citadels, their roots drinking deep from long-forgotten graves. Flowers bloom in the mouths of stone-carved kings, and ancient altars, once belonging to mortals, now serve as perches for luminous fungi and moss-cloaked creatures.

Here, the cycle of life does not end, nor does it follow the natural order. Flesh and plant intermingle, and those who perish in the Ruin do not rot; they become one with the greenery, their bodies repurposed into the endless bloom of Faelith’s forgotten paradise.

The Ruin stretches beyond the horizon, a tangled, suffocating wilderness, where the very air is thick with spores, dust, and golden motes of light. Many who step inside find themselves losing time, wandering through paths that seem to shift as if the trees themselves conspire to mislead intruders.

To remain in the Ruin too long invites change upon the body. Wounds do not fester but sprout, fingers grow into branches, and eyes become buds of flowering vines. Some willingly surrender to this transformation, while others resist, only to wake and find roots binding their limbs to the earth.

Despite the thick canopy, a golden glow lingers in the Ruin, radiating from the flora itself. The deeper one ventures, the more the light seems to breathe, pulse, and watch.

At the very heart of the Ruin lies Faelith’s petrified body, half-buried in a sea of blossoms and tangled vines. Though lifeless, it pulses with divine remnants, and some claim to hear a heartbeat beneath the roots.

Pilgrims and [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]] alike gather here, offering bone, seed, and sacrifice, hoping to stir the Blooming Mother from her slumber. The very air is thick with golden pollen, and many who breathe it lose themselves in visions of a world that never was.

Few enter the Ruin willingly, for even those who do not fear its creatures will succumb to its grasp. It is a place where Faelith’s will lingers, but whether she watches over it or merely lies at rest beneath its roots is unknown.

Deep within, where colossal roots twist through shattered temples and the land itself pulses with unnatural life, lies [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/Settlements/The Chapel of Decay\|The Chapel of Decay]] - the last great gathering place of the Mycari, the fungal descendants of Faelith.
