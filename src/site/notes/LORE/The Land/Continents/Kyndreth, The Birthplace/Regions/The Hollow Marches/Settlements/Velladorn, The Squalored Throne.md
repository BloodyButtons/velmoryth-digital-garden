<center>THE CITY OF FETID NOBILITY </center>

---
![VELLADORN_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/VELLADORN_PORTRAIT.jpg)

Velladorn, the Squalored Throne. Once the proud capital of a vast empire, its streets now rot beneath the weight of its own delusions. The nobles who remain here do not acknowledge the world’s decay. They dress in tattered finery, hold endless feasts at empty tables, and dance through crumbling halls in masquerades of denial and madness.

To walk through Velladorn is to enter a city trapped in a self-inflicted lie. The aristocracy, still believing themselves lords of an empire long gone, enforce decrees upon empty streets, conduct war councils over imaginary foes, and knight their own children for victories never won. The city still functions, but only as an imitation of its past glory.

At the center of it all sits Varith the Vain, first of [[LORE/Factions/The Wraith-Kings\|The Wraith-Kings]], masked Lord of Velladorn. It is said he has not removed his mask in centuries, and some whisper that beneath it, there is nothing left at all.

The city is not empty, but those who remain are bound to their roles by force, duty, or sheer desperation.

The nobility is clad in fading silks and porcelain masks, pretending nothing has changed. They hold court, pass decrees, and execute traitors who dare to break the illusion.

The servants, mostly [[LORE/Mortals/The Undead\| Undead]] and [[LORE/Mortals/Strayborn\|Strayborn]], sweep streets that will never be clean and mend tapestries that will never be whole. They pour wine into goblets that never empty. They are trapped by oaths, fear, or some enchantment of the past.

The noble dead shuffle through the manors and halls, their decayed flesh adorned with finery, refusing to accept that they have long since died.

The Masked Legion, Velladorn’s last knights, enforce laws of a kingdom that no longer exists, ensuring that the city’s delusion is never broken.

[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/The Hollow Marches\|The Hollow Marches]] is a place where the past will not die, and Velladorn is its festering heart. To break the illusion is to invite death, or worse, exile. Many wanderers enter Velladorn and never leave, trapped in the masquerade until they too become part of its false nobility.

Yet despite its decay Velladorn remains a place of power. Relics of the old empire, untouched vaults of knowledge, and treasures hoarded by the noble dead still rest in its gilded ruins. Those who dare to break the illusion or play along just long enough may yet find something worth the risk.

**But how much of yourself would you have to give before the masquerade welcomes you as its own?**
