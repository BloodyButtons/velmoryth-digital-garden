<center>THE BIRTHPLACE</center> 

---

Kyndreth was the first landmass ever created by the gods. It took the entire Divinity to make its carve its vast regions from the earth. 

Once the heart of Velmoryth’s great civilizations, it is now a place of decay, sorrow, and unfulfilled legacies. [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]] scarred the land irreversibly, leaving behind broken kingdoms, haunted ruins, and landscapes tainted by divine remnants and unnatural forces.

It is a continent where the past refuses to die, and the future seems a distant, impossible dream. Here, the remnants of Velmoryth’s greatest powers linger, whether in the form of crumbling citadels, restless undead, or [[LORE/Factions/The Wraith-Kings\| Wraith-Kings]] clinging to their hollow thrones. 

# The Regions of Kyndreth

Kyndreth is not a land for the weak of spirit. It is a place where the bones of the old world still jut from the earth, where the weight of dead gods lingers in the air like a held breath. Those who walk its roads do not do so lightly, for every step is a wager against the land itself.

In [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/The Gloam Mire\|The Gloam Mire]], the air is thick with whispers, the water grasping at ankles like the hands of the drowned. 

[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/The Hollow Marches\|The Hollow Marches]] stretch on without end, where the living tread the same path as the dead, and funeral processions never find their graves.

[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\|The Hungering Ridge]] looms, carved as if by a starving thing, swallowing travelers whole in its endless gullet of shadow and stone. 

[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/The Verdant Ruin\|The Verdant Ruin]] is a sickness of green, where roots creep and vines strangle, feeding on more than mere soil.

And [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/The Silent Plains\|The Silent Plains]], where even the wind has abandoned its vigil, leave behind a stillness that should not be.

**Kyndreth does not welcome. It does not shelter. But those who endure it become part of it, as unyielding as the land itself.**
