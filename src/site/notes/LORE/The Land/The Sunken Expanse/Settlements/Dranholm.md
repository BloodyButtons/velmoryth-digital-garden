<center>AT DEATH'S GATE</center>

Dranholm, oh Dranholm.

Even now the name clings to the tongue like a half-remembered hymn- sweet at first, but souring upon the breath. There was a time, or so we are told, when its towers split the clouds like needles of sunlight, and the banners of [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn, The Dawn King]] fluttered from every golden arch and marble colonnade. They say it was the first city of [[LORE/Mortals/Humans\|mankind]], not the first raised, but the first ordained, chosen by the Dawn King himself, a gift of kingship carved into the stone with divine decree.

How it came to be is a tale steeped in myth. Veryn, wreathed in his first light, descended from the heavens after the forging of Time. He found the early tribes of Man scattered, brutal, and hungry. And yet he saw in them a spark not even the Elves could contain. From that spark, he lit a flame. With his own radiant hand, he drew the first foundations into the earth, bidding the stones to hold memory, the wood to hold lineage, and the waters to hold truth.

And so rose Dranholm the Crown of the Southern Waters, the Sun’s Seat. The River Haldrin, once meandering and nameless, was bound to its causeways and carved into sacred geometry. Streets followed the pattern of the constellations. Statues of old kings bowed forever toward the east, where the light first broke. The Great Basilica, with its dome of burnished gold, could be seen from leagues out at sea. To walk its courts was to be judged by history itself.

But history, like kings, is mortal.

[[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]] fractured the world. And with it, Dranholm.

When the gods fell from their thrones and the world turned upon its makers, it was said that Dranholm would endure, that the flame of Man would remain lit even in the darkness of divine silence. But Dranholm became the battleground, the final theater, [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt, The Betrayer]], last of the gods, had fled across the earth sowing rot in his wake. When all others had fallen, he gathered the remnants of divinity like carrion, whispering poison into the very soil. Mortals, at last united in desperation, forged [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Anathema, The God Killer\|Anathema, The God Killer]], and struck him down at the very gates of Dranholm.

And there they made their mistake.

[[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Landmarks/The Vault of Treachery\|The Vault of Treachery]] was sealed with rites few now remember. Chains of flesh and iron, words etched in the bones of kings, blood spilled not in battle, but in oath. They cast him below. But a god, even bound, even broken, still bleeds.

And Dranholm drank deep.

The [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Miasma\|Miasma]] did not come as smoke or fire. It came as silence. First, the bells stopped ringing. Then, the fountains flowed black. The sun, once so faithful to its chosen city, began to rise just slightly off-course, as if uncertain where Dranholm lay. The people forgot days. Entire plazas were swallowed by salt. Moss crept up the legs of statues and whispered prayers in tongues no man had carved. The sea rose not with rage, but with solemn purpose, and took what it could.

Now?

Dranholm lies half in ruin, half in memory. Its upper tiers cling to the cliffs like barnacles on a god’s corpse. Streets end in staircases that vanish into the sea. Hollow palaces echo with voices that should not be, repeating ceremonies no one attends. The drowned bells toll sometimes at midnight, though no ropes are pulled. Undead nobles in finery stained with brine hold court beneath shattered mosaics. And below it all, the Vault remains. Some say it pulses with light when the moon is full. Some say it cries.

No ship sails too near. [[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\|The Ragged Caravan]] makes offerings when crossing the upper waters, casting tokens of bone and salt into the deep. [[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]] avoid its gates altogether, for they say there are no oaths there that hold firm, yet still they keep a watchful eye. [[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]], fools that they are, send pilgrims to walk its avenues in silence, seeking oblivion.

Dranholm is not a ruin.

It is a tomb, buried before it died, still breathing through the mouth of the sea.
