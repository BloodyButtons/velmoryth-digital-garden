<center>A PRISON OF ROT AND DESPAIR</center> 

---

The Vault of Treachery. Even now, the name tastes sour upon the tongue, like ash laced with blood. It is not a vault in the way one thinks of vaults- no treasure rests within, no relics or tomes or king’s ransom. It is a wound. A cage carved into the ribs of the world, sealed not with key and stone, but with sacrifice and despair. 

Here lies [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt, The Betrayer]]. Or what remains of him.

No mortal saw his birth. He was not shaped in the image of creation, but rather in its shadow as an echo of rot, the god of endings that should never have begun. When the gods turned fell to hubris and turned upon each other, it was Morkhalt who whispered in their ears, who bartered divine secrets in exchange for decay. It was he who stoked the fire that became the Rebellion, who promised freedom through death, order through entropy.

And when the last great war reached its fever pitch, when the bodies of gods fell like stars and the sky itself cracked, he stood alone. Still laughing. Still whispering.

The Mortals, wearied, ruined, gathered together what courage they had left. The [[LORE/Mortals/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] brought the forge. The [[LORE/Mortals/Elves\|Elves]], the runes. [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] carved time into shape and called upon [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel]]’s last remaining echoes. And from all of them, [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Anathema, The God Killer\|Anathema, The God Killer]] was forged, starsteel drawn from fallen sky, cooled in god-blood, sharpened by sorrow.

At the gates of [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]], in the shadow of the sunken throne, they struck Morkhalt down. Not killed- for gods do not die so easily, but bound. Driven into the earth like a stake through the world’s heart, sealed beneath the very city he had corrupted, chained in a vault that was less chamber and more... sentence.

The Vault was not built, but born from the convergence of pain. Its walls are black glass veined with screaming iron, a shape not quite real, always shifting just beyond sense. It is said the air there tastes of forgetting. That time does not pass within it, only loops. The seals- seven in all, were etched into living flesh, carved into the bodies of those who remained behind to guard it. They did not die. They are still down there, somewhere, circling his prison. Hollowed. Reverent.

No one who enters returns. Not truly. The First Magi no longer speak of it, except in riddles and weeping. [[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]] claims it is the final door to the world’s rightful end. [[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\|The Flesh Merchants]] once sent a caravan seeking godflesh beneath the waters and they never came back, but their masks wash ashore still, smiling.

And what of Morkhalt?

He does not sleep.

The [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Miasma\|Miasma]] that bleeds from the Vault poisons the sea and the soil. It coils around thought. It raises the dead. His chains rust, but do not break. He is bound not just by metal, but by memory, by myth, by the will of a world trying to forget him.

But forgetting is not the same as silence.

Some say he sings. Not with voice, but with absence. That the Choir was born the moment Anathema shattered in his flesh, the moment divinity ruptured under mortal hands. That it was not merely his blood that leaked out, but truth- the kind no world can endure.

And should the Vault ever open again, should even a single seal fail...

It will not be a god who emerges.

But a truth unshaped.

And none shall remember we were ever here.
