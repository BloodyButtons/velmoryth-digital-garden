<center>THE SEA OF TORMENT</center>

---



Lo, I have looked upon the sea, and the sea did not blink. It is a cruel thing, the Sunken Expanse- a monstrous mirror stretched between the scarred continents of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Kyndreth\|Kyndreth]] and [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Valndir\|Valndir]], reflecting not the sky, but some deeper sorrow. Its waves do not crash in fury nor sing in salt-borne joy, as they did in the songs of my youth. Nay, they weep. They churn with a quiet, listless hunger, as though they mourn what was taken and what was sealed.

The Expanse is not merely water, friend. It is a wound. A vast, abyssal scar left by [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|the war of gods]], and at its heart lies the weeping corpse of a dream once called [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]].

Dranholm! Gods, how far it has fallen. Once, it crowned the world like a diadem, Veryn’s chosen jewel, a city of alabaster towers and gold-threaded avenues, where kings ruled not with iron but with light. Now it leans, broken-backed, into the sea like a drunkard too proud to drown. Its streets lie submerged, its spires pierce the heavens no longer, and its people- what few remain, walk half in ruin, half in memory. The bells no longer toll. The courts hold no council. The dead wear crowns and speak in riddles.

But it is not the ruin of Dranholm that keeps me from sleep.

Beneath it, deeper than any mariner dares chart, lies [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Landmarks/The Vault of Treachery\|The Vault of Treachery]]. It is there that [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt, The Betrayer]], was unmade and remade in chains. The final act of mortal defiance, they say. The god of rot and ruin was cast down, sealed beneath a city once made holy. How poetic. How utterly, bitterly insufficient.

For the Vault did not kill him. It did not stop the miasma. It merely delayed it.

The sea is thick with it now. A creeping blackness that clings to ships’ hulls and sears through canvas sails. Coral bleeds from the ocean floor, twisted into unnatural shapes, and beasts once docile now swim with blind, white eyes and mouths unfit for this world. Fishermen return with netfuls of flesh they dare not eat. Some do not return at all. And still, the tide rises. Still, the wind carries whispers.

I walked the broken piers of Dranholm once. I saw, with my own cursed eyes, the waters part not in miracle, but in mourning. From beneath, a cathedral of barnacled bone rose in the moonlight, its spires rusted with divine ichor. No doors barred it, but I dared not enter. For in the waves I saw them- figures without breath, faces without time. Knights in crumbling mail. Priests mouthing sermons to things that should not be. I heard the sound of chains, and a sob that split the sea like thunder.

He still weeps, the god we buried.

He weeps, and the world rots with him.

So mark well this place, ye wanderers and fools. The Sunken Expanse is not a crossing. It is a grave, and the grave is not sealed. Avoid the dead lights in the deep. Trust not the currents.

And if ye must pray, do so in silence.
