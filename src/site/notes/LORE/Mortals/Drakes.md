<center>VORRASH'S HUNGER MADE MANIFEST</center> 

------------------------------------------
![DRAKES_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/DRAKES_PORTRAIT.jpg)

When the dragon queen [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash, The Hunger]] was sealed beneath [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\|The Hungering Ridge]], the Drakes went into hiding.

They were her chosen warriors, meant to test the strength of the world. Towering, scaled, and blessed with the fury of their creator, they once led great campaigns of conquest and trials of strength.

Without their leadership some sought new rulers, while others believed they must rule themselves.

Infighting and the fall of [[LORE/The Land/Skykeep\|Skykeep]] led to the collapse of their great citadels, reducing them to scattered warbands. Some seek to unseal Vorrash, hoping to reclaim their lost purpose. Others have become warlords, fighting to forge their own dominions. A few have abandoned their old ways, becoming mercenaries, wanderers, or scholars.

Whatever the case may be, they are now completely decentralized. It is very rare to find more than a few together at once.
