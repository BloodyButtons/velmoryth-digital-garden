<center>SYLTHARIEN'S PERPETUAL ENFORCERS</center>

------------------------------------------
![MACHINATIONS_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/MACHINATIONS_PORTRAIT.jpg)

Not born, but created by [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]], the Machinations were meant to be his perfect enforcers of divine law.

They were once soulless constructs, but after the Elvish Liberation, Syltharien began binding captured elves into their frames, creating the Soul Cages.

When Syltharien perished, the Machinations awakened again, now fully sentient but bound by broken laws. Some still enforce these laws, passing judgment on those who trespass into their ruins.

Others have developed independent wills, seeking purpose in a world without their master, free from his command.

Some have gone mad, their directives broken, their actions no longer making sense. They currently make their home in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/Settlements/Rustcradle\|Rustcradle]], a bastion stolen from [[LORE/Mortals/Humans\|mankind]] after [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]]. 

It is here that the **Soul Cages** are made, devices of impossible construction formed by [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]] himself. [[LORE/Chronology/The Sunlit Age#^5bec4c\|The Elvish Liberation]] forced him to do so, as his only means of defending [[LORE/Factions/The Perpetual Order\|The Perpetual Order]].

Soul Cages form the basis of a Machination's construction. Essentially **they are a sentient mortal soul ripped from its physical form to pilot these suits of blazing silver armor.** The death of [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\| The Architect]] unbound these souls, and they are now fully sentient again - trapped in an iron maiden of their own folly. 

Most Machinations are Elven, but over the course of [[LORE/Chronology/The Age of Decay\|The Age of Decay]] many other mortal races have been captured, to preserve [[LORE/Factions/The Perpetual Order\| the Order]] or die trying.
