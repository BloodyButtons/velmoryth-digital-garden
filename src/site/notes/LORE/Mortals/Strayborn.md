The Strayborn are those without souls, lost and adrift in a world that does not claim them. Some appear almost human, but others are mindless husks simply taking up space in the world. No one understands from whence they came - ***for perhaps they come from nowhere.*** 

Surfacing after [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]], the Strayborn do not belong to the cycles of life and death. They do not age and they cannot die naturally. Some say they are another vestige of [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]], some advanced form of [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/The Harrow\|The Harrow]] that seeks to overtake the mortal plane.  Others have sympathy for them, as one might have for a child without parents. 

Whatever the case may be, many seek to understand their existence. They delve deeper and deeper into the ruins of the world, hoping for a chance at uncovering their origin. The largest number of Strayborn simply seek an end to their unfathomable existence - they never asked to be created, they have no god to worship, and yet they suffer **unimaginably**. Those seeking this end, this ultimate cessation of experience, gather at [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Wound of The Earth/Settlements/The Black Hollow\|The Black Hollow]] alongside [[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]]. Others simply fade into obscurity, their presence barely noticed in a world that never asked for them.
