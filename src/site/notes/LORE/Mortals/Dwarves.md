<center>DHORAK'S FADING AMBITION</center>

-------------------------------------------
![DWARVES_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/DWARVES_PORTRAIT.jpg)

Forged by [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]], the Dwarves were the first craftsmen, shaping metal, stone, and fire at their god’s command. Their fortresses once stood unbreakable, their forges the heart of creation. A stout and hardy people, decorated by their own craftsmanship.

They were master artisans, making incomprehensibly complex pieces of machinery, weapons, and craftsmanship alike. When [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]] came [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]] refused to take sides, leaving his beloved sons to follow the masses and eventually craft [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Anathema, The God Killer\|Anathema, The God Killer]]. 

The Dwarves, now without the [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Forgefather]]'s instructions, have creating for gods or kings.

Many abandoned their halls, while others sought to ignite the last embers of Dhorak’s flame.

[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/Settlements/The Crucible\|The Crucible]] is a dwarven fortress where the final smiths attempt to reforge lost glory.

Some experiment with dangerous technologies, blending machinery with flesh.

Others roam the world, searching for Dhorak’s final weapon, believing it will determine Velmoryth’s fate.
