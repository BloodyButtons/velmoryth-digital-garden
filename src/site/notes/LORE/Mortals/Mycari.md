<center>FAELITH'S LINGERING PRESENCE</center>

![MYCARI_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/MYCARI_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The Mycari are [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]]'s last living creation, living beings of fungal growth, their heads crowned by mushroom caps and bioluminescent spores. They were meant to tend the forests, spread life, and nurture the land.

When [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]] perished, the Mycari lost her voice, leaving many to wander mad and broken.

Some became twisted aberrations, their spores spreading uncontrollable mutations.

Others cling to her memory, trying to preserve the last uncorrupted nature.

The last Mycari with a semblance of purpose resolutely guard their home, [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/The Verdant Ruin\|The Verdant Ruin]]. These creatures are known as [[LORE/Factions/Faelith's Rotguard\|Faelith's Rotguard]], and they vehemently protect their Blooming Mother's corpse, however crestfallen it may be.
