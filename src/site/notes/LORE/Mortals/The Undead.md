<center>MORKHALT'S CHOSEN FEW</center>

-------------------------------------------
![UNDEAD_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/UNDEAD_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The Undead were once mortals, now puppets of [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]]’s corruption. They were the first to fall to his miasma, forever lingering in a state between life and death.

Some undead retain fragments of their minds, trying to reclaim lost lives. Others serve as vessels for [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]]’s will, mindless husks driven only by his cursed whispers.

The most tragic are those who do not realize they are dead, forever reliving their last days, doomed to repeat them for eternity.

**A select few of Undead have resurfaced fully sentient, ancient souls trapped inside rotting corporeal form.** They woke to their homes and countrysides razed to the ground, the [[LORE/Chronology/The Sunlit Age\|Sunlit]] world they once knew in eternal twilight. They search for an answer to this curse, for an end to the cycle. However sentient they may be, these Undead are still reviled by all manner of life across Velmoryth.
