<center>SYLTHARIEN'S BROKEN ORDER</center> 

-------------------------------------------
![ELVES_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/ELVES_PORTRAIT.jpg)

The Elves were crafted by [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]], the Architect of Order, meant to be his enforcers, record-keepers, and judges. Their mastery of logic, beauty, and control made them perfect stewards of his laws, the very ones that upheld *the order of reality itself.* They were elegant and ethereal, waif-like in their form.

Their [[LORE/Chronology/The Sunlit Age\|rebellion]] and theft of [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Eternal Lexicon\|The Eternal Lexicon]] has left them reviled by many of the other mortal races in hindsight, and **they are hunted by [[LORE/Mortals/Machinations\|Machinations]], for their crimes to this very day.** 

What little remains of the Elves reside in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Settlements/Eldermere Sanctuary\|Eldermere Sanctuary]], protecting [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] so that they may find an answer to [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]]'s corruption or find a way to combat [[LORE/Factions/The Perpetual Order\|The Perpetual Order]].

Others that roam the wilds are generally ousted by most societies. Some have joined the warbands of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Shattered Coast/Settlements/The Den\|The Den]] or [[LORE/Factions/The Gloamwardens\|The Gloamwardens]], but many have been reduced to vagrancy.
