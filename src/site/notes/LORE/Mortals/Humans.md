<center>VERYN'S LAST CHILDREN</center>

-------------------------------------------
![HUMANS_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/HUMANS_PORTRAIT.jpg)

Veryn's children are widely known for their adaptability. After all, it was them who coined the phrase "Jack of all trades, master of none." 

Created by [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn]],  humans were meant to rule and guide the mortal world under divine decree. **They were given fire, steel, and ambition**, *making* them the most adaptable of the races. Kings and nobles once ruled by divine mandate, their bloodlines touched by godly essence.

The death of their loving father left them unguided and fractured into feuding city-states, crumbling dominion, and ruthless warbands.

Many still cling to lost tradition in a desperate attempt hopes of a response from their long dead creator, but they cannot undo what they have done. 

[[LORE/Factions/The Lasthearth Tribunal\|The Lasthearth Tribunal]] represents humanity’s last major attempt at unity, but it is a fragile coalition at best, under constant attack by [[LORE/Mortals/The Undead\|The Undead]], [[LORE/Mortals/Machinations\|Machinations]], and [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Shattered Coast/Settlements/The Den\|The Den]] alike. [[The Flesh Merchants\|The Flesh Merchants]] threaten the outskirts, in daily conflict with [[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]].
