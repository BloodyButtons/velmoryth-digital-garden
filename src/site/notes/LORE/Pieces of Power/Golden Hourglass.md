They say the world was still once.

Not dead. Not alive. Merely unmoving. There was no decay, for there was no beginning. No end. No change. Until he arrived.

Zephariel, the Veilborn. The first to breathe before the breath of the gods. Not born of the world, but born to begin it. And so he did, not with blade or decree, but with a device- *the Golden Hourglass*.

It is not metaphor. It is not parable. **It is real**. A physical relic from before the world had substance. Fashioned from starlight and entropy, the hourglass did not merely measure time, it began it. The moment the first golden grain passed through its neck, the first second of creation took form. Light followed. Matter bent. Sound found its voice. And the gods, who had once been unshaped notions of desire and power, coalesced into form. Mortals were not far behind.

The Hourglass was both gift and chain. With its first breath, it shackled the infinite into cause and consequence. The gods, for all their might, would one day wither. The world would know aging. Time made death possible.

[[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel]] placed the hourglass atop the tallest spire of the world then called the Peak of Stillness. Now, we name it [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Landmarks/The Eye of Zephariel\|The Eye of Zephariel]], and it weeps ruin upon [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Shattered Coast/The Shattered Coast\|The Shattered Coast]]. When [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]] threatened all things and [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Eternal Lexicon\|The Eternal Lexicon]] was stolen, Zephariel fled. Whether in sorrow or shame, none can say. But before his vanishing, he shattered the hourglass.

Perhaps he feared what might be done with it. Perhaps he feared what had already been done.

The hourglass broke as time itself had begun- with a whisper, not a roar. The grains spilled outward, scattering across Velmoryth like searing golden ash. The few who have found one say it is warm, impossibly heavy, and humming with unbearable promise. A single grain is said to slow time, to delay a deathblow, or let a seer glimpse moments yet to be. But the cost is that the grain cannot be stopped. It moves. Once loosed, it continues to fall, to burn, to take.

The remains of the hourglass, they say, still rest at the summit of Zephariel’s Eye. But none reach it.

Not because it is forbidden but because it is impossible.

The tower quickens all who ascend. Time spirals violently the higher one climbs. Witnesses describe companions crumbling into dust before the second stair. Hair bleaching white. Skin thinning. Joints stiffening. Screams that begin as young voices and end in brittle gasps. The very concept of progression becomes a weapon.

There are ruins within the tower, frozen silhouettes, some mid-step, others slumped against walls, withered and hollow. One such statue is said to bear the armor of a [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|First Magus]]. Another wears the sigil of a [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|Dirge-Bearer]]. One clutches a journal, its final entry an incoherent plea:

"I must see it again. I must. I must-"

No one knows what would happen were the hourglass restored. Would it reverse all things? Unmake the war, the gods, the betrayal?

There are those who dream of such power. That if they rewound the world to that moment the Eternal Lexicon was shattered, they might stop it. That they could chain fate.

But the truth is far crueler.

This is the end of the line.

The path always leads here. The War was inevitable. [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]] was inevitable. The decay, the hollowing, the final breath of divinity—all fated the moment the first grain of sand fell.

Even if one were to bring time itself to heel and return the world to its golden birth, it would not matter.

Because it is not the world that is broken.

It is us.
