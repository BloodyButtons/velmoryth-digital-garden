The Lordsblade was [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn]]'s implement. He wielded it with deft and merciless wrath against his siblings as well as [[LORE/Mortals/Humans\|mankind]] in [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]]. It was a mighty weapon, capable of laying entire cities to waste in a single strike. 

When [[Veryn, The Dawn King \|The Dawn King]] fell at the hands of his most trusted companions, Lordsblade was lost. Some say the can feel the heat of its divine flame emananating from the ground somewhere near [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Ashen Reaches/Landmarks/Godsgrave\|Godsgrave]], but none can say for sure...
