We do not speak its name lightly.

Anathema.

It was not a weapon. It was a verdict cast in iron, star-fire, and divine memory. Not forged for glory. Forged because there was nothing else left.

By the end of [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]], the gods had been slain, entombed, or broken- yet one remained. [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt, The Betrayer]]. The Rotfather. His gifts were rot, undeath, secrets wrapped in suffering. He did not build temples or demand offerings. He whispered. And by the time we understood, his roots were already beneath our feet. His altar was the corpse of the world.

He was the last obstacle, not to victory, but to silence.

We did not forge it in glory. No hymns were sung as hammer met steel. No drunken boasts beside hearthfires. We wept when we made it. Wept, Because we knew what it would be used for. Because we knew it would be the last of our great works. And because we knew it would mark the end of gods and all things touched by them. We quenched it not in oil, nor water, but in the ichor of the dead gods, harvested from the battlefield of [[LORE/The Land/Skykeep\|Skykeep]]’s fall. It shrieked when cooled. Some of us never slept again after hearing it.

In one final moment of unity, the mortal peoples gathered. A fleeting alliance: [[LORE/Mortals/Elves\|Elves]] humbled by ruin, [[LORE/Mortals/Humans\|Humans]] hollowed by grief, the [[LORE/Mortals/Drakes\|Drakes]] with their dying queen, [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]] sullen and unblinking under their fungal crowns, even the first [[LORE/Mortals/Machinations\|Machinations]] free from [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]]'s control. They came to our forges not to seek salvation, but closure. The war had to end. Even if the world did not survive the peace.

I saw the blow struck. I saw the spear driven into the god of death.

When Morkhalt was struck down beneath the drowned stones of [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]], it was not triumph. There was no cheer. The strike did not kill him. It could not. It bound him, buried beneath that flooded corpse of a city, sealed where no voice might reach.

But Anathema shattered.

It could not endure its own purpose.

Some say it tore a hole in the Veil itself. That the act of trying to kill the last of the divine did not save us. It wounded the world further. Something from beyond, something we still do not understand, far older and greater than any divinity, took notice. From the splinters of that broken spear came the first notes of [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Weeping Choir\|The Weeping Choir]]. From that wound in reality, [[LORE/The Weeping Choir/The Harrow/The Harrow\|The Harrow]] crawled. From the silence, came the Song.


Now, its pieces are scattered. Lost. Some say they call to one another, aching to be whole again. Others claim that each shard contains a name, a final word that can never be spoken aloud. Some are worshiped. Some are hunted. Others are entombed in black vaults beneath cities that pretend not to listen to the voices in the dark.

If you find one, burn it. Bury it. Flee it.

But do not listen.

Do not listen.
