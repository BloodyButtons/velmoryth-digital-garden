They are not written, they are grown. Not ink, not paint, not etched with hammer and chisel. A Flesh Glyph blooms, as if the world itself remembers it, and insists that we do too.

These are not [[LORE/Economy/Writs/The Last Writs\|The Last Writs]]. The world knows the difference. Writs are currency, carved from remnants of the powerful and convicted, imbued with the fading residue of long-dead laws. Their value lies in trade, in the blood-soaked economy of a dying world. Glyphs, true Glyphs, are not for purchase. They are not minted. They are not carried.

They are borne.

A Flesh Glyph is a mark of unspoken intent, a piece of the world’s ancient grammar impressed into matter. When found they are most often dormant, scarred into weathered stone, lingering in the marrow of fallen beasts, or pulsing beneath the skin of those marked by fate or madness. And should one possess the means, the knowledge, and the will to bind a Glyph into weapon or armor, something unnatural occurs. The object becomes awake.

Blades branded with Glyphs do not simply cut, they remember what they strike. Armor woven with Glyph-thread doesn’t merely protect, it rejects impact, resists entropy, repels sorceries not through strength, but through denial. A sword marked with a Glyph of Wounding might open gashes that will never heal. A shield bearing a Glyph of Holding might anchor its bearer to the earth like a mountain, unmoved even by the breath of a god. But the weapon does not become an extension of the bearer. Rather, the bearer becomes a vessel for the Glyph’s purpose.

These marks do not obey. They demand. And the more powerful the Glyph, the heavier the toll. Minds fray. Flesh decays. Conviction wavers. To wield a Glyph-bound weapon is not to carry strength- it is to *host it*.

Not all Glyphs are martial. The rarest- some believe only seven remain- serve as keys to sealed places: vaults buried in the bones of the world, locked chambers beneath ruined sanctuaries, pathways closed by gods who feared what lay beyond. These Glyphs, called Nullstones or Keyrunes by some, are closely hoarded or actively destroyed. [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]] claim one lies hidden in the catacombs beneath [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/Settlements/Grimholt\|Grimholt]]. [[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\|The Flesh Merchants]] insist they once bartered for a piece that opened a [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/Landmarks/The Threshold Of Dust\|“breathing door”]] in the [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Silent Plains/The Silent Plains\|The Silent Plains]]. Whatever the truth, it is known that these Glyphs are not used lightly. If a door is sealed by a Glyph, it was meant to stay sealed.

The Flesh Merchants covet Glyphs above all else. To them, they are not divine, they are artifacts of ownership. They believe each Glyph was created by an original Will, a being who once held power over flesh, form, and fate. To possess one is to hold a sliver of that authorship. The Merchants have entire sects devoted to decoding Glyph structures, crafting prosthetics and weapons wrapped in living runes. They do not worship Glyphs, nor fear them. They harvest them. Grow them. Tattoo them into the skin of their constructs and themselves alike. It is said that the highest of their order bear dozens of runes stitched into their flesh, each bound by pain, silence, and secrecy.

Most others fear Glyphs as relics of a language too old and too absolute. [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] of their temptations. [[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]] seeks them out for destruction, believing each mark draws Velmoryth closer to its end. [[LORE/Factions/The Steel Apparitions\|The Steel Apparitions]] avoid them altogether, save for the most steadfast of mind. Even those desperate enough to wield cursed blades shy away from the corruption of a Glyph. The song of the Choir hums near them, as if something listens when a Glyph is used.

But despite all this, they endure.

Because in a world broken by silence and ash, where gods lie dead and kings wear rotting crowns, power still holds weight.

And the Glyphs?

They remember what power was.

And they have not forgotten how to speak.
