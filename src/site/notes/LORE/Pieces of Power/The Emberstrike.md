<center>DHORAK'S IMPLEMENT</center>

---

They call it The Emberstrike, though that was never its true name.

No. Among the old tongue of the forgebound, among the whispered chants beneath molten arches, it was known only as Khardûm-Ur: The Flame that Carves the World. But in this tongue, in the broken breath of this dying age, we name it simply what it was, [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]]’s hammer.

It was not made. It was born. Or rather, it was kindled.

Forged in the first flame ever shaped by mortal hand, quenched in a chalice of stardust and fireblood, its haft wrapped in the hide of the first to offer themselves to Dhorak’s forge. Its head is said to be hewn from the core of a fallen star- starsteel. It bore runes upon its sides, runes that glowed not with flame but with intention, the divine script of creation itself.

With it, Dhorak forged the first anvil upon which the bones of mountains were shaped. With it, he sang fire into iron, whispered form into formlessness. He did not build merely tools or weapons, he birthed the mortal world’s order of craft, of strength, of making. It was the hammer that shaped the first gates of [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]], the first spires of [[LORE/The Land/Skykeep\|Skykeep]], and the mountain homes of the [[LORE/Mortals/Dwarves\|Dwarves]].

But in [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]], even such tools were turned toward ruin. Some say Dhorak shattered cities with the Emberstrike when the gods turned upon each other. Others claim he struck down a godling in one final act of vengeance before retreating into silence. When the war ended, and the gods fell or vanished, the Emberstrike was lost.

Or hidden.

The dwarves of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/Settlements/The Crucible\|The Crucible]] do not speak of its whereabouts, but I have read the ash-scrolls, there are those who claim it was buried in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\|The Hungering Ridge]], deep within a crevice where flame still breathes but no forge dares burn. The Ridge is a place of ruinous hunger, where ancient furnaces collapse in upon themselves and molten veins pulse like dying hearts. It is said even the [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Miasma\|Miasma]] shies from it, for something burns too pure beneath.

They say the Emberstrike calls to those worthy. Not through voice, but through the ache of the bones, through dreams of fire that does not burn. Some who have sought it speak of being drawn toward a forgotten forge, long buried, surrounded by statues of dwarves who never lived, each one locked in reverent silence, weeping tears of slag.

[[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] believe it still contains the blueprint for divine creation. [[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]] believe its reawakening would be sacrilege. [[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\|The Ragged Caravan]] will trade a king’s ransom for a single flake of metal that might have come from its edge.

But none have found it.

Not truly.

And perhaps that is mercy.

For if Emberstrike were to rise again, it would not be as a tool. Not this time.
This time, it would not shape the world.

It would remake it. Or break it in the trying.
