They say it was never truly a book.

It was a Law, not written, but woven. Not read, but understood, all at once, by those capable of bearing its weight. We called it the Eternal Lexicon, though its name shifted with the tongues of the gods who shaped it. It was the Codex of First Binding, the Scripture of the Unmade Sigil, the Mirror of All That Is and Could Yet Be.

[[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien, The Architect of Order]], wrought it at the dawning edge of time when [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel]]’s [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Golden Hourglass\|Golden Hourglass]] still turned, when the gods still walked the world in form unbroken. It was his answer to chaos, to want, to freedom. A perfect mechanism, inked with the divine algorithm of the cosmos. Every law, every limitation, every structure of reality itself etched into its ever-shifting pages.

It did not exist in any one place. It existed wherever it was read. Those who beheld it did not open it. It opened them. Mortal minds were not built for such clarity; to understand the Lexicon was to be pinned beneath the full weight of reason, to see the world not as it is, but as it was meant to be.

The [[LORE/Mortals/Elves\|Elves]] were its first guardians, carved by Syltharien’s will to enforce the Lexicon’s decrees. They were law given flesh, logic without flaw. But flesh is flawed, and logic… well, logic leads always to questions.

And so they rebelled.

They called the Lexicon a prison. They claimed that freedom could not exist within a world so tightly bound. That the song of magic- the true, raw weave of existence, had been locked away within the Lexicon’s binding. They shattered it, and in doing so became [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]].

That was the moment the Elvish Liberation began, and with it, [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]].

No one remembers what happened to the Lexicon’s core. Some fragments were stolen, yes- used to weave the first mortal spells, crude parodies of divine law. Other pieces were said to burst from reality itself, sinking into the seams of the world, awaiting reassembly. The First Magi believe its pieces still hum, buried deep within ruins or etched into bones or stones that bleed language when struck.

To wield a page of the Lexicon is to wield absolute knowledge, even if for only a heartbeat.

And then it collapses.

That is why magic breaks things now. It was never meant to be torn from the Lexicon. It is not whole, and thus, every casting is an act of theft of violence against the order of the world.

Some believe the Lexicon still exists in full, hidden in a pocket of reality untouched by decay. Others whisper that it is unwriting itself, slowly dissolving as the last remnants of divinity fade. A few mad scholars claim it was never written at all- that it is still writing itself, fueled by the suffering of Velmoryth’s fall.

But I have seen a page.

It screamed when I touched it. Not ~~aloud~~, but within my mind it shrieked like a banshee of forbidden knowledge. It showed me a future where every breath had purpose, every death had meaning. It showed me a world without chaos. Without magic.

Without me.

I burned it. I had to.

Because if even a fragment could make me doubt my own soul, I dare not think what power the whole would bring.

Let it stay lost.

Let it stay buried.

Let the world rot, rather than live bound in perfect law.
