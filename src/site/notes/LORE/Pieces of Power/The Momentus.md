The gods do not forget. That is what I was taught as a child, hunched beneath frostbitten scroll-shelves, listening to the wind scream through the broken keep.

But [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel]]… Zephariel remembers.

There is a difference.

Where the others built, bled, and warred over Velmoryth’s matter and spirit, Zephariel stood apart- firstborn of the Veil, Father of Time. He did not rule. He did not shape earth or flame or flesh. His gift was record, and from that gift came the first breath of existence. Without him, the gods might still wander endlessly in a single instant, warring and wondering forever.

The Momentus was his reckoning, his burden and his brilliance.

Not a book. Not a device. Not a scroll.

A recording soul, forged from the dust of the Veil and bound by the first tick of his [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Golden Hourglass\|Golden Hourglass]]. It took form in different ways- some say it appeared as a wheeling astrolabe, suspended in a dome of stars. Others saw it as an endless coil of parchment, unfurling itself without end. Those madmen who once tried to glimpse beyond time’s veil, said it was a mirror: cracked, endless, and staring back.

But all agreed on one truth—it contained every moment that had ever been. And worse still, every moment that could be.

Zephariel wrote it. He lived it. With every breath, he watched the skein of time knit itself forward, backward, inward. The Momentus bound him to the world not as a master, but as its memory. Its reflection.

Some believe it was the weight of the Momentus that broke him. That in knowing all that would be, he became fractured, haunted by endings he could not unmake. He did not fight in [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|The War of Hubris]], not truly. When the gods fell, Zephariel fled, vanishing beyond the Edge of the Sky, leaving behind only the shattered Golden Hourglass, and the Momentus, abandoned, its tether to divinity undone.

But the record does not end.

The Momentus still exists. Or so some claimed, before they walked into silence.

They say it is hidden in the fractures of Velmoryth’s time-wounds, in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/The Hollow Marches\|The Hollow Marches]] where funeral processions never cease, or within [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]], where the dead relive their deaths. Some even claim the fragments of the Momentus bleed into dreams, into déjà vu, into those cursed with precognition and madness.

I once met a man who had a shard of it nailed into his spine etched like a gear, clicking softly when he turned his head. He said he could see the moments between heartbeats. He died weeping, crushed beneath the weight of a thousand futures that could not be changed.

If the Momentus were found in full, if it could be rebuilt…

Some dream of using it to restore the world, to rewind, to rewrite, to undo. And yet what would change? Would the cycle not repeat? Are we not doomed to our fate?

But others whisper darker things. That the Momentus is not merely a record.

It is a sentence.

A final line to be read only when the last moment comes.

And when it is read, the story ends. Not with a scream. Not with a war.

But with a full stop.

And silence eternal.
