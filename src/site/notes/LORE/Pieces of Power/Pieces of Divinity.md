<center>THE LOST FRAGMENTS OF GODHOOD</center>

---

To say the gods are dead is to misunderstand what death means. Their bodies may be scattered, their thrones crumbled to moss and ruin, but they do not rest. Not truly.

For what is divinity if not persistence beyond the flesh?

And so there remain pieces. Shards. Leftovers from the making and unmaking. The lingering remnants of beings too vast to ever wholly die.

We call them many things- Relics, Bones, Shards, Fragments of Grace, the Dying Echoes, but their truth is singular: they are the pieces of gods, and they are still alive.

Some appear mundane at first glance. A cracked shield buried in a battlefield long lost to memory. A golden tooth found in the belly of a drake that burns with a quiet heat. A bone flute whose melody bends time. But those who hold them feel the weight not of the object, but of memory. Of intention.

These are not mere tools. They are wills, fossilized.

The Bones of [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]] still pulse in the root-veins of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Verdant Ruin/The Verdant Ruin\|The Verdant Ruin]], the sap within glowing with slow, mournful light. [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]] who drink from these wells speak in her voice for brief, terrible moments. In [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/Settlements/Rustcradle\|Rustcradle]], the Last Cog of [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien]] still ticks, despite the silence of the world it counts down to something, though none can read its measure.

A sword blackened by the sun, once wielded by [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn]] himself, was seen cutting through phantoms in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Ashen Reaches/Landmarks/Godsgrave\|Godsgrave]]. A spine-like string of glyphs, carved into a steel chain, is said to whisper the secrets of [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]]’s final design if wrapped around one’s throat. There are rumors of [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash]]’s blackened armor, petrified in stone, still pulsing faintly in the bleeding rocks of [[LORE/The Land/Skykeep\|Skykeep]]’s ruin.

Some remnants are more ethereal- shards of voice, caught in the air like birdsong that will not die. Echoes of divine edicts, still reverberating in cracked cathedrals. These are more dangerous than any weapon, for they speak directly to the soul. [[LORE/Factions/The Dirge-Bearers\|The Dirge-Bearers]] once claimed to have heard the final word of [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]]’s betrayal carried on the tide. One slit his own throat shortly after, lest he utter it aloud.

Not all remnants are kind. Many are cursed. Some whisper endlessly, even in sleep. Others burn the flesh to brand their wielder with forgotten symbols. Some do nothing at all until the bearer reaches a place they should not be.

[[LORE/Pieces of Power/Flesh Glyphs\|Flesh Glyphs]] sometimes form in the presence of such relics, symbols etched into mortal skin by proximity alone, mutating the body into a vessel for divine memory. Others claim bones can still bleed, and that those who drink of that ichor see visions not of the past, but of the future that never came to be.

These pieces are not hunted lightly. Those who seek them often vanish, or worse return changed, mouths speaking truths in languages older than stone. [[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\|The Ragged Caravan]] deals in such things, rarely, and only under veils and silence. [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]] guard those they’ve found, locking them away in the deepest vaults of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Settlements/Eldermere Sanctuary\|Eldermere Sanctuary]]. [[LORE/Factions/The Blooded Covenant\|The Blooded Covenant]] will kill for them, seeing in every fragment the hope of ascension. [[LORE/Factions/The Hollow Creed\|The Hollow Creed]] seeks to destroy them, fearing that so long as these shards exist, the world may never truly end.

As for the common folk? Most dare not speak of them. A relic kept beneath one’s hearth might bring blessing or curse the generations to come. A ring said to hold the breath of [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel]] once granted a man perfect memory… until it became so heavy with time he could no longer move.

And still they persist.

These are not trinkets. These are pieces of gods.

To touch one is to open the self to something too vast for flesh to hold.

And when one finds such a relic, the question is not “What will I do with it?”

But: “What does it want of me?”
