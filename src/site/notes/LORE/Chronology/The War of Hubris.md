# Ramifications of Freedom

When [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien, The Architect of Order]] was felled at the hands of his own creations **the fundamental laws of reality began to collapse, and divine order became a thing of the past.** [[LORE/Chronology/The Sunlit Age\|The Sunlit Age]] had come to a close.

No longer did the mortal races follow their creators' whims, no more did they **love** them. 

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn]]'s [[LORE/Mortals/Humans\|Humans]] were the next to rise up. Their compassion for their mortal brothers and sisters knew no end, and they wanted more for themselves. They began to question the Dawn King's will. They wanted thrones of their own.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]]'s [[LORE/Mortals/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] set their hammers down. No longer would they make by divine decree. They began crafting weapons of war, brutal machinations of unethical torment. In the end, the Dwarves would make the ultimate weapon, **something capable of killing a god.** 

- The [[LORE/Mortals/Drakes\|Drakes]] of [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash]], bred for war, turned against their mighty queen. The clans fractured as their Draconic overlords stood in defense of their mother. 

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]] wept as she watched her [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]] twisted by the uncontrollable flow of magic. A once peaceful people distorted by violence razed nature itself to the ground.

**And for the first time, the gods would turn their own blades against their creations.**

# The Gods Turn Against Each Other 

As the centuries-long war raged on and on, the gods became desperate for resolution. A once loving family became bitter and jaded. And something foul stirred in the background...

[[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]] watched. He plotted. Kingdoms fell, razed to ash and blood. He walked those carrion fields and wondered. Could he bring them back? He experimented with the deceased all the while, and in his foolish arrogance he created [[LORE/Mortals/The Undead\|The Undead]]. He knew that none would survive this, no divinity would escape this hellish existence, but **they would.** He sent them to the dark corners of the world in wait, in hopes that when all was done **his creation and his alone would be left to walk the earth.**

[[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|The Betrayer]] whispered into the ears of mortals and divine alike, driving them further to depravity. He sought the end of all, for all would return to him. He gave the mortals the forbidden knowledge of the weakness of gods, so that they may claim their stake in the heavens. He turned sibling against sibling, until there was nothing left.

The Divinity finally met on even footing at [[LORE/The Land/Skykeep\|Skykeep]], where they would have their final duel. It was a cacophonous maelstrom of violence, and it tore the floating city from the very sky itself. In one fell moment, [[LORE/The Land/Skykeep\|Skykeep]] exploded across the horizon, raining down in unrelenting wreckage. 

At this final site, the gods waged brutal combat against one another, and [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Wound of The Earth/The Wound Of The Earth\|The Wound Of The Earth]] was left in its place. A gaping chasm in reality where the Veil seeped in. They were damaged and afraid. For the first time since the dawn of existence **the gods were weakened.** 

As war erupted across [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Kyndreth\|Kyndreth]] and [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Valndir\|Valndir]], the [[LORE/Mortals/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] worked tirelessly with newfound knowledge. They would make [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Anathema, The God Killer\|Anathema, The God Killer]]. A massive crystalline spear imbued with the essence of the Veil itself. It could rip body from soul, and mind from matter. It would tear the Divinity asunder. Although tensions were high between the mortal races, they knew this was their chance to end things.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]] fell first, her body laying in the southern regions of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Kyndreth\|Kyndreth]]. Nature went unchecked. [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]] twisted in aberrant creatures of bloodlust, rivers flowed red, storms drowned the land in acidic rain. So began the death of the world.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn]] came down from his heavenly throne in a blazing carnage of fire and viscera, landing in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Ashen Reaches/Landmarks/Godsgrave\|Godsgrave]], [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Ashen Reaches/The Ashen Reaches\|The Ashen Reaches]]. [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Lordsblade\|Lordsblade]] was never found. The sun dimmed, and the land was cast into eternal dusk.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash]], in ravenous hunger, consumed most of the [[LORE/Mortals/Drakes\|Drakes]]. Almost none were left, until she was at last bested by her children. They sealed her underneath [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/The Hungering Ridge\|The Hungering Ridge]], where even in death her fury still spews forth from underneath the mountains.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak]] collapsed under the weight of his own creation. His forges went cold and silent and the [[LORE/Mortals/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] lost their ambitions.  

 - [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel]] watched, still recording all in a futile hope that somehow there could be a light at the end of this horrid tunnel. But there was not, and he left. He did not leave just the mortal plane, he left **the entirety of existence.** Time itself was fractured.

In the end, only [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]] remained. 

# Morkhalt's Imprisonment

When all was done,  the last kings of mortal kind gazed upon their wretched claim with regret. The war had spiraled out of control. Everything was destroyed. There was no light left to bask in. No love. Only the slow and merciless march of death and decay.

They looked towards [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt]] with disdain. For they ***knew*** it was him. It was ***him*** who whispered thoughts of dissent into their ears. It was ***him*** who tempted the [[LORE/Mortals/Elves\|Elves]]. But they still had it.

They still had the [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Anathema, The God Killer\|Anathema, The God Killer]]. 

They gathered at [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]] and beckoned [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|The Betrayer]]. He met them equally, his arrogance knowing no bounds. In a final desperate act, he was struck with the Anathema, shattering it into countless pieces. ***But you cannot kill the god of death with a single strike.*** 

They sealed him beneath Dranholm inside [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Landmarks/The Vault of Treachery\|The Vault of Treachery]]. 

Half dead, void of divinity, [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt, The Betrayer]] festers in the deep. His [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Miasma\|Miasma]] 
corrupts the very earth itself. The dead rise in droves. Nature is wild, untamed, and hostile in its twilight hours. Mortals fight over whatever scraps are left. This is the present.

This is [[LORE/Chronology/The Age of Decay\|The Age of Decay]].
