The Age of Decay is the current, dying era of Velmoryth, a world in the throes of its final breath. The gods are dead, their war of hubris having left scars upon reality itself. Once-great civilizations are now crumbling monuments to arrogance, their rulers pretending that the world still follows the laws of kings and divine order.

The war of the gods did not bring salvation; it left only ruin, sickness, and a world slowly unraveling. The divine forces that once shaped the world are now fractured remnants, bleeding into the land in ways that should not be possible.

**Nothing is whole. Nothing is stable. Nothing is sacred.** 

# The State of the Wider World

As it stands, Velmoryth is a rotting corpse. A shadow of its past in crumbling ruin and depravity. The mortal remnants of this plane are scattered and ideologically divided. There are few places left where they gather, and even fewer where they live peacefully. **There is no safe haven. There is no respite.** 

The majority of trade and economy has crumbled, the undead roam unimpeded, and the very earth itself is poisoned - corrupted by [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Miasma\|Miasma]]. 

# The Remains of Mortal Kind 

Mortals, as a result of [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|the great war]], have become divided, seeking only to sustain themselves. What little spark of hope and good remains in the world is fading quickly, and only those who have fallen to depravity and self indulgence truly survive. Many factions have sprung up around various regions in a desperate attempt to band together.

------------------------------------------
# The Commonfolk
------------------------------------------
![CIMMONFOLK_PORTRAIT.jpg](/img/user/IMAGES/CIMMONFOLK_PORTRAIT.jpg)

 The closing of [[LORE/Chronology/The Sunlit Age\|The Sunlit Age]] means that Velmoryth is no longer a place to live - **it's a place to survive.** What little remains of a functioning economy is sequestered to the remaining settlements and their insulated communities. The Commonfolk have no place in this world.

- Agriculture has crumbled as [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]]'s death has meant the corruption of the land. What little crops grow here are not enough to sustain communities. 

- Many people have resorted to cannibalism, meaning that most small villages have fallen to feral madmen.

- The [[LORE/Mortals/The Undead\|undead]] running rampant have resulted in various strange rituals. Some people leave flesh on their doorsteps to satiate supernatural hunger and keep it away from their families. Others gather in village militia to purge them from their homes. 

- Many fathers and brothers alike venture out in hopes of finding some form of respite for their families, but few return.

There is **nothing left** for the average person. If you have not aligned yourself with a faction, if you have not put yourself first or set aside your morals to make the most of all you have, **you are as good as dead in Velmoryth.**

## Common Ritual

- The Unseen Prayer
    Spoken in hushed tones, wordless prayers meant to avoid attracting the wrong kind of attention.

------------------------------------------

- The Weeping Offerings
    Small bowls filled with salt, bone dust, and blackened petals, left outside homes to ward off spirits.

------------------------------------------

- The Death Candles
    Each household keeps a candle burning at all times; if it is ever snuffed out, it is believed to be an omen of imminent death.

------------------------------------------

- The Rusted Blade Oath:
    A dying warrior’s sword is buried in rusted earth, believed to prevent them from rising again in undeath.

------------------------------------------

## The Last Shelters of the Common People

Most home of the average man are barely standing ruins, patched with wood and scavenged cloth to block the wind. In places where the surface is too dangerous, some communities have dug deep, living in tunnels lined with old bones and flickering lanterns.

Warlords and self-proclaimed rulers commandeer ancient castles and fortresses, forcing commoners to live in servitude in exchange for protection.

Some dwell in [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Gloam Mire/The Gloam Mire\|The Gloam Mire]] or [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/The Sunken Expanse\|The Sunken Expanse]], where rotting wooden walkways and tethered boats serve as makeshift homes.

 [[LORE/Factions/The Ragged Caravan\|The Ragged Caravan]] wander between ruined cities, trading what little they have for food and shelter.

## The Struggle of Survival 

- Fungal Farming
     In the absence of fertile soil, most villages rely on [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]]-grown fungi to sustain themselves. Some mushrooms are nutritious, others poisonous, and a rare few are said to contain faint whispers of [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith]]’s will.

------------------------------------------

- Marrow Bread
     A dense, bitter bread made from ground bone and powdered roots, baked in rudimentary stone ovens.

------------------------------------------

- Salted Carrion
     Meat from fallen creatures, beasts, drakes and even corrupted things are salvaged and preserved through heavy salting, a necessity in regions where fresh livestock is rare.

------------------------------------------

- Rotten Offerings 
     Some leave spoiled food at their doorsteps, believing that offering a share of their meal to the dead will keep them from rising.

------------------------------------------

- Hunting and Scavenging
     Those capable venture into the wilds, foraging for anything edible - though poisonous growths, diseased game, and predatory creatures make it a deadly task.

------------------------------------------

- Cannibalism
     While taboo in most settlements, in places where food is scarce, some have turned to the flesh trade, and others to eating **anyone** that crosses their path.
