# The Dawn

When the gods had made the world, they basked in its glory- for a time.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn, The Dawn King]] sat upon his throne in [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]], a crowning jewel of the sea.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak, The Forgebearer]] burrowed deep into the mountains making a home for himself and his forge. [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Emberstrike\|The Emberstrike]] clanged against holy anvils day in and day out.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith, The Blooming Mother]] secluded herself in her forests, peaceful as ever. 

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash, The Hunger]] took to the skies to see the world from above. She wanted its glory all at once.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien, The Architect of Order]] made [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Eternal Lexicon\|The Eternal Lexicon]], so that he may enact its laws. He made his great libraries, and locked himself inside, hoping to give structure to his siblings' creations.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt, The Betrayer]] simply watched. He did not want part of it, for he knew that one day it would all be dust.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel, the Veilborn]] sat and watched as well, but from the outside. He took no part. He wanted no part. He diligently recorded his siblings' works, knowing that it would be needed. 

# The Apex

And yet even after they made the land, the gods grew bored still. Never satisfied, they would make **mortal life** to populate the realm. And so it goes. 

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn, The Dawn King]] made the first [[LORE/Mortals/Humans\|Humans]], mortal aspects of his burning ambition and will to command. They were resourceful and resilient, sequestered in their golden cities of righteous order - [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hollow Marches/Settlements/Velladorn, The Squalored Throne\|Velladorn, The Squalored Throne]], [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Wound of The Earth/Settlements/The Black Hollow\|The Black Hollow]], [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Iron Wastes/Settlements/Rustcradle\|Rustcradle]], and [[LORE/The Land/The Sunken Expanse/Settlements/Dranholm\|Dranholm]]. 

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien, The Architect of Order]] made his [[LORE/Mortals/Elves\|Elves]], stewards of diving order and record keepers of His knowledge. They were lithe and strong, yet graceful and intelligent. If nothing else, they lived and died by their God's word. In the [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Regions/The Veiled Highlands/Settlements/Eldermere Sanctuary\|Eldermere Sanctuary]], they kept their records and lived in blissful enlightenment.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak, The Forgebearer]] made [[LORE/Mortals/Dwarves\|Dwarves]]. They toiled and toiled in the mountainhomes of [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Regions/The Hungering Ridge/Settlements/The Crucible\|The Crucible]], crafting pieces of weaponry or armor that no other race could compare to. Among all, they were masters of craft. Stout and hardy people, that held righteous faith in their creator.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith, The Blooming Mother]] made her [[LORE/Mortals/Mycari\|LORE/Mortals/Mycari]], guardians of her beautiful nature. They were a wise people, ageless and sexless crowned with mushroom caps. Fungal manifestations of Her will. They only sought to preserve and prosper, they only wanted peace in their home.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash, The Hunger]] made [[LORE/Mortals/Drakes\|Drakes]], humanoid dragons, content with living in the skies above. They scared and screamed, and they were hungry just like their mother. They were a barbaric people, cunning yet intelligent in their scathing ferocity. The clans lived nomadically, each borne of their own element - derived from the Dragons themselves. Once a year they would gather at [[LORE/The Land/Skykeep\|Skykeep]], the floating city.

# The Beginning of The Fall & The Elvish Liberation

The gods held generous dominion over their peoples in the coming millenia. Peace and prosperity reigned in a way unfathomable to the current state of the world. But **everything is fleeting.** 

As eons passed and Elves kept their records, **Syltharien** kept a tight grip on their comings and goings. His order was the way, it was what kept reality balanced. Nothing would stray from it, lest everything fall to ruin.

Even the Elves did not know what they were doing.

Yet as time passed on, they caught glimpses of their maker's forbidden wisdom. A flash here and there, The Architect rambling to himself in his quarters. Curious pointed ears would listen, but they **learned too much.** 

Magic in its purest form was a force of chaos, and Syltharien knew this. He knew it was a force too great to wield, only his closest mortal followers could even begin to understand it. [[LORE/Factions/The First Magi\|The First Magi]], as they were known, were weavers of The Veil. They could transmute matter, control natural elements, and warp space and time itself. But their pride in their abilities was perhaps too great. 

In a fleeting moment of hubris, the Magi stole [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Eternal Lexicon\|The Eternal Lexicon]], and ripped its pages from the binding. 

Sylthatien was enraged, and the Elves broken hearted that their glorious master would keep such a thing from them, that he would not trust them. They **warred against him** uprising in a violent coup that lasted centuries. Magic would eventually drive most of them mad, and few remained after. Those the Architect had killed became his [[LORE/Mortals/Machinations\|Machinations]], disembodied suits of blazing silver armor who mindlessly followed his orders. The Elves would end up having to fight themselves if they wanted to win, killing mother, father, sister, and brother alike.

**Syltharien fell in a death knell that would sound [[LORE/Chronology/The War of Hubris\|the beginning of the end]].**
