# The Veil 

The infinity before creation stretched an unfathomable distance. At the beginning of existence there was no time, no concepts or order, no wanting or needing, no separation.

Reality - or the lack of it was just that, **an empty void, dark and oppressive.** It was a stillness, untouched by divine or mortal hands. This is known as ***The Veil***. 

# The Beginning of Time

A raging star. A burning light. A shimmering cacophony, burning into nonexistence. This was [[LORE/The Divinity/Zephariel/Zephariel, the Veilborn\|Zephariel, the Veilborn]]. He stood alone in the emptiness and basked in it. With a snap, **time and space** came into existence. In his left hand, [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Momentus\|The Momentus]]. In his right, his [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Golden Hourglass\|Golden Hourglass]]. With these divine instruments he would record every happening in every age, until the very day he would fall.

# The Birth Of The Gods

In the same snap that created time and space The Assemblage came into being. Zephariel's younger siblings. 

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Veryn/Veryn, The Dawn King\|Veryn, The Dawn King]] struck his imprint into existence, a towering figure of gleaming sunlight ready to lead his siblings with his [[LORE/Pieces of Power/Lordsblade\|Lordsblade]] in hand.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Syltharien/Syltharien, The Architect of Order\|Syltharien, The Architect of Order]] manifested in a blinding blue. He would impose structure and order. He would command the void, for he had the knowledge to.

- The sound of a hammer blared into the silence, and [[LORE/The Divinity/Dhorak/Dhorak, The Forgebearer\|Dhorak, The Forgebearer]] burned into being. His hammer [[LORE/Pieces of Power/The Emberstrike\|The Emberstrike]] rested at his side.

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith, The Blooming Mother]] came to greet her brothers next. She brought warmth, and growth. She was loving and understanding. 

- [[LORE/The Divinity/Vorrash/Vorrash, The Hunger\|Vorrash, The Hunger]] made her way to her sister. Though polar opposites, she and [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith, The Blooming Mother]] stayed by each other. But at the same she tested her siblings' revolve, and she was merciless.

+ [[LORE/The Divinity/Morkhalt/Morkhalt, The Betrayer\|Morkhalt, The Betrayer]] came last, as he always knew he would. He stayed away from his siblings, sequestered in his own corner of the veil.

# Kyndreth and Valndir

For some time, the gods reveled in each other's presence. They felt at home with their families, but like all things, it was too little. They yearned for more, and so they **made more.** 

[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Kyndreth\|Kyndreth]] came first, but the gods simply called it *The Birthplace*. And it was beautiful. [[LORE/The Divinity/Faelith/Faelith, The Blooming Mother\|Faelith, The Blooming Mother]] watered the rivers and planted the forests. She molded the mountains and painted the skies. It was her first creation. She held it close.

[[LORE/The Land/Continents/Valndir, The Wandering Land/Valndir\|Valndir]] was next, a sister to [[LORE/The Land/Continents/Kyndreth, The Birthplace/Kyndreth\|Kyndreth]] yet beautiful in its own right. Its warm sands were a comfort to the gods in their time. The swamps and plains, places of refuge.  

Velmoryth was coming into shape. And yet, something still lacked, some kind of [[LORE/Chronology/The Sunlit Age\|spark]]...
